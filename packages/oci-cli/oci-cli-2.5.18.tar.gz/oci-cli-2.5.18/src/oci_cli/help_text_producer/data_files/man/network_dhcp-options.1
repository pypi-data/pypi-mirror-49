.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A set of DHCP options. Used by the VCN to automatically provide configuration information to the instances when they boot up. There are two options you can set:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%DhcpDnsOption\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/DhcpDnsOption/\fP>: Lets you specify how DNS (hostname resolution) is handled in the subnets in your VCN.
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%DhcpSearchDomainOption\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/DhcpSearchDomainOption/\fP>: Lets you specify a search domain name to use for DNS queries.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new set of DHCP options for the specified VCN. For more information, see \fI\%DhcpOptions\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/DhcpOptions/\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the set of DHCP options to reside. Notice that the set of options doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the set of DHCP options in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the set of DHCP options, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
