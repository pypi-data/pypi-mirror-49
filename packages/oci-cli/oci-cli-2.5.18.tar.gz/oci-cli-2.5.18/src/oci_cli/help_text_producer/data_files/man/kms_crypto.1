generate\-data\-encryption\-key
.UNINDENT
.SS decrypt
.SS Description
.sp
Decrypts data using the given DecryptDataDetails resource.
.sp
The top level \-\-endpoint parameter must be supplied for this operation.
.SS Usage
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci kms crypto decrypt [OPTIONS]
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.SS \-\-ciphertext [text]
.sp
The encrypted data to decrypt. [required]
.SS \-\-key\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the key used to encrypt the ciphertext. [required]
.SS \-\-associated\-data [complex type]
.sp
Information that can be used to provide an encryption context for the encrypted data. The length of the string representation of the associatedData must be fewer than 4096 characters.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-logging\-context [complex type]
.sp
Information that can be used to provide context for audit logging. It is a map that contains any addtional data the users may have and will be added to the audit logs (if audit logging is enabled)
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
