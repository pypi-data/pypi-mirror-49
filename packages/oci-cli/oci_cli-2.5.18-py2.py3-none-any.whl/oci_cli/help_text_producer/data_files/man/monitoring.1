.sp
A user\-friendly name for the alarm. It does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
This name is sent as the title for notifications related to this alarm.
.sp
Example: \fIHigh CPU Utilization\fP [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment containing the alarm. [required]
.SS \-\-metric\-compartment\-id [text]

.SS \-\-namespace [text]
.sp
The source service or application emitting the metric that is evaluated by the alarm.
.sp
Example: \fIoci_computeagent\fP [required]
.SS \-\-severity [text]
.sp
The perceived type of response required when the alarm is in the "FIRING" state.
.sp
Example: \fICRITICAL\fP [required]
.SS \-\-destinations [complex type]
.sp
An array of \fI\%OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> to which the notifications for this alarm will be delivered. An example destination is an OCID for a topic managed by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notification service.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[required]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \-\-is\-enabled [boolean]
.sp
Whether the alarm is enabled.
.sp
Example: \fItrue\fP [required]
.SS \-\-metric\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.sp
When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy\-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, the alarm evaluates metrics from only the compartment specified in metricCompartmentId. Default is false.
.sp
Example: \fItrue\fP
.SS \-\-resolution [text]
.sp
The time between calculated aggregation windows for the alarm. Supported value: \fI1m\fP
.SS \-\-pending\-duration [text]
.sp
The period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must persist before the alarm state changes from "OK" to "FIRING" or vice versa. For example, a value of 5 minutes means that the alarm must persist in breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "FIRING"; likewise, the alarm must persist in not breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "OK."
.sp
The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (\fIPT10M\fP for ten minutes or \fIPT1H\fP for one hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H. Default: PT1M.
.sp
Under the default value of PT1M, the first evaluation that breaches the alarm updates the state to "FIRING" and the first evaluation that does not breach the alarm updates the state to "OK".
.sp
Example: \fIPT5M\fP
.SS \-\-body [text]
.sp
The human\-readable content of the notification delivered. Oracle recommends providing guidance to operators for resolving the alarm condition. Consider adding links to standard runbook practices. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIHigh CPU usage alert. Follow runbook instructions for resolution.\fP
.SS \-\-repeat\-notification\-duration [text]
.sp
The frequency at which notifications are re\-submitted, if the alarm keeps firing without interruption. Format defined by ISO 8601. For example, \fIPT4H\fP indicates four hours. Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: P30D.
.sp
Default value: null (notifications are not re\-submitted).
.sp
Example: \fIPT2H\fP
.SS \-\-suppression [complex type]
.sp
The configuration details for suppressing an alarm.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Simple key\-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross\-compatibility only. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp

.SS \-\-query\-text [text]
.sp
The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non\-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: \fIgrouping()\fP, \fIgroupBy()\fP\&. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see \fI\%Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm\fP>\&. For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service.

The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non\-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: \fIgrouping()\fP, \fIgroupBy()\fP\&. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see \fI\%Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm\fP>\&. For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See \fI\%Supported Services\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-resolution [text]
.sp
The time between calculated aggregation windows. Use with the query interval to vary the frequency at which aggregated data points are returned. For example, use a query interval of 5 minutes with a resolution of 1 minute to retrieve five\-minute aggregations at a one\-minute frequency. The resolution must be equal or less than the interval in the query. The default resolution is 1m (one minute). Supported values: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP).
.sp
Example: \fI5m\fP
.SS \-\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.sp
When true, returns resources from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy\-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment specified in compartmentId. Default is false.
.SS \-\-query\-text [text]
.sp
The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to use when searching for metric data points to aggregate. The query must specify a metric, statistic, and interval. Supported values for interval: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: \fIgrouping()\fP, \fIgroupBy()\fP\&. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see \fI\%Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm\fP>\&. For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See \fI\%Supported Services\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
