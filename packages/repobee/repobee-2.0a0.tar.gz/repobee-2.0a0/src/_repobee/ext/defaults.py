"""The defaults plugin contains all default hook implementations.

The goal is to make core parts of repobee pluggable using hooks that only
return the first result that is not None. The standard behavior will be
provided by the default plugin (this one), which implements all of the required
hooks.  The default plugin will always be run last, so any user-defined hooks
will run before it and therefore effectively override the default hooks.

Currently, only the peer review related generate_review_allocations hook has a
default implementation.
