"""
    Devices
    =======
    Collection of drivers for different devices which are useful to perform measurements. Drivers may depend on
    external libraries. Thus, be aware that you may need to install some dependencies in order to make the
    controllers work correctly. A common example is the requirement of pyvisa to communicate with serial devices,
    or the DLL's from Hamamatsu in order to use their cameras.
