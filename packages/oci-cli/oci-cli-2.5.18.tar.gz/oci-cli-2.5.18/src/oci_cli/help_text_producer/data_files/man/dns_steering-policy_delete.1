.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-steering\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the target steering policy. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-Match\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the existence of at least one current representation of the target resource, when the field\-value is \fI*\fP, or having a current representation of the target resource that has an entity\-tag matching a member of the list of entity\-tags provided in the field\-value.
.SS \-\-if\-unmodified\-since [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-Unmodified\-Since\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation\(aqs last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field\-value.  This field accomplishes the same purpose as If\-Match for cases where the user agent does not have an entity\-tag for the representation.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACTIVE|CREATING|DELETED|DELETING]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
