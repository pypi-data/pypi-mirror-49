create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new cross-connect group to use with Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see FastConnect
Overview.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the cross-connect group to reside. If
you're not sure which compartment to use, put the cross-connect group
in the same compartment with your VCN. For more information about
compartments and access control, see Overview of the IAM Service. For
information about OCIDs, see Resource Identifiers.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect
group. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid
entering confidential information.

--wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|PROVISIONED|INACTIVE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If
timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other
error, a return code of 1 is returned.


--max-wait-seconds [integer]
----------------------------

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by --wait-for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
