Description: # World Trading Data Python SDK
        
        **This is an _UNOFFICIAL_ SDK. That means that neither this repo nor the author have any 
        relationship with World Trading Data. This repo is simply a tool built to make it easier to 
        integrate with the rest API.**
        
        _This SDK is designed to access financial data. Therefore the author would like to stress that 
        what you do with any data you may get through this SDK is your problem and yours alone. I take 
        absolutely zero responsibility for any losses or problems that may arise from using this SDK_
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        This SDK will require you to have an account with World Trading Data (sign up 
        [here](https://www.worldtradingdata.com))
        
        Be advised, there are as yet no stable releases for this package and it is 
        100% definitely still in development and breaking changes (while avoided) may be deployed 
        at any time. You have been warned.
