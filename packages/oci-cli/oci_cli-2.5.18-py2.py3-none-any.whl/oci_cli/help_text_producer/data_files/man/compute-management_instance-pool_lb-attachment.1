Attach a load balancer to the instance pool.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-instance\-pool\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the instance pool. [required]
.SS \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the load balancer to attach to the instance pool. [required]
.SS \-\-backend\-set\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the backend set on the load balancer to add instances to. [required]
.SS \-\-port [integer]
.sp
The port value to use when creating the backend set. [required]
.SS \-\-vnic\-selection [text]
.sp
Indicates which VNIC on each instance in the pool should be used to associate with the load balancer. Possible values are "PrimaryVnic" or the displayName of one of the secondary VNICs on the instance configuration that is associated with the instance pool. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|SCALING|STARTING|STOPPING|TERMINATING|STOPPED|TERMINATED|RUNNING]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
