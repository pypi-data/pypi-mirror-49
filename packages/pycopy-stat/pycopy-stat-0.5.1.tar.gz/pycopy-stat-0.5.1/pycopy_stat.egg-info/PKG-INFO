Description: This is a module ported from CPython standard library to be compatible with
        Pycopy project (https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy). Usually, this means that
        small patches were applied for features not supported (yet, or at all) in
        Pycopy. Sometimes, heavier changes might have been done. Note that CPython
        modules are written with availability of vast resources in mind, and may not
        work for Pycopy ports with limited heap memory (RAM). If you are affected by
        such a case, please help reimplement the module in minimalistic way from
        scratch.
Platform: UNKNOWN
