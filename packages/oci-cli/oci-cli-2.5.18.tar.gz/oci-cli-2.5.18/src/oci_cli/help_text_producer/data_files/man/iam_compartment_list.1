.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list returned depends on the values set for several parameters.
.sp
With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation returns only the first\-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in \fIcompartmentId\fP\&. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child compartments (grandchildren).
.sp
The parameter \fIaccessLevel\fP specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).
.sp
The parameter \fIcompartmentIdInSubtree\fP applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned. To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment), set the parameter \fIcompartmentIdInSubtree\fP to true and \fIaccessLevel\fP to ANY.
.sp
See \fI\%Where to Get the Tenancy\(aqs OCID and User\(aqs OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). If not provided, this parameter will use the tenancy from the config file.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous "List" call.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call.
.SS \-\-access\-level [ANY|ACCESSIBLE]
.sp
Valid values are \fIANY\fP and \fIACCESSIBLE\fP\&. Default is \fIANY\fP\&. Setting this to \fIACCESSIBLE\fP returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). For the compartments on which the user indirectly has INSPECT permissions, a restricted set of fields is returned.
.sp
When set to \fIANY\fP permissions are not checked.
.SS \-\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.sp
Default is false. Can only be set to true when performing ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned depending on the the setting of \fIaccessLevel\fP\&.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
