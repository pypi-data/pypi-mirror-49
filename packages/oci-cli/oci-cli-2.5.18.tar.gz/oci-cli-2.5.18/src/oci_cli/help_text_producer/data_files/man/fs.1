.SS export
.SS Description
.sp
A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export resource belongs to exactly one export set.
.sp
The export\(aqs path attribute is not a path in the referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file system.
.sp
The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more slash\-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with the same export set, except those in a \(aqDELETED\(aq state, the path element sequence for the first export resource can\(aqt contain the complete path element sequence of the second export resource.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For example, the following are acceptable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
/example and /path   * /example1 and /example2   * /example and /example1
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following examples are not acceptable:   * /example and /example/path   * / and /example
.sp
Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.) or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.
.sp
No two non\-\(aqDELETED\(aq export resources in the same export set can reference the same file system.
.sp
Use \fIexportOptions\fP to control access to an export. For more information, see \fI\%Export Options\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/File/Tasks/exportoptions.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

\fBNote:\fP Mount targets do not have Internet\-routable IP   addresses.  Therefore they will not be reachable from the   Internet, even if an associated \fIClientOptions\fP item has   a source of \fI0.0.0.0/0\fP\&.
.sp
\fBIf set to the empty array then the export will not be   visible to any clients.\fP

This option is a JSON list with items of type ClientOptions.  For documentation on ClientOptions please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/filestorage/20171215/datatypes/ClientOptions\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

Mount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can provide as the host portion of remote target parameters in client mount commands. These private IP addresses are listed in the privateIpIds property of the mount target and are highly available. Mount targets also consume additional IP addresses in their subnet. Do not use /30 or smaller subnets for mount target creation because they do not have sufficient available IP addresses. Allow at least three IP addresses for each mount target.

.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]

.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
