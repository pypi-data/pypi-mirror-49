.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. Bucket names must be unique within an Object Storage namespace. Avoid entering confidential information. example: Example: my\-new\-bucket1 [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The ID of the compartment in which to create the bucket. [required]
.SS \-\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Arbitrary string, up to 4KB, of keys and values for user\-defined metadata.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-public\-access\-type [NoPublicAccess|ObjectRead|ObjectReadWithoutList]
.sp
The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to \fINoPublicAccess\fP by default, which only allows an authenticated caller to access the bucket and its contents. When \fIObjectRead\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP, \fIHeadObject\fP, and \fIListObjects\fP operations. When \fIObjectReadWithoutList\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP and \fIHeadObject\fP operations.
.SS \-\-storage\-tier [Standard|Archive]
.sp
The type of storage tier of this bucket. A bucket is set to \(aqStandard\(aq tier by default, which means the bucket will be put in the standard storage tier. When \(aqArchive\(aq tier type is set explicitly, the bucket is put in the Archive Storage tier. The \(aqstorageTier\(aq property is immutable after bucket is created.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-kms\-key\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of a KMS key id used to call KMS to generate the data key or decrypt the encrypted data key.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
