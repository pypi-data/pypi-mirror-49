Description: Instead of using the flask test client, you can use this package
        which does a similar job. This wrapper to the flask test client has an API based on the
        'requests' HTTP client library. This means that you can write tests or monitoring which
        works with either requests (for when you want to test against a real web server) and this
        package, for when you want to run your tests using the built-in capabilities of flask.
