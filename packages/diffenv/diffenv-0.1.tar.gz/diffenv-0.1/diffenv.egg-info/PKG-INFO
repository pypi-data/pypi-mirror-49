        ## Development
        
        In order to run a development install run:
        
        ```console
          # depending on your setup you may have to prefix sudo to this command
          python3 setup.py develop
        ```
        
        The above should keep updating with local changes to your repository.
        
        If you ran the above command with `sudo`, you may have to do the following:
        ```console
        sudo chown -R youruser:youruser diffenv.egg-info dist
        ```
        
        Now you can run
        ```
          diffenv
        ```
