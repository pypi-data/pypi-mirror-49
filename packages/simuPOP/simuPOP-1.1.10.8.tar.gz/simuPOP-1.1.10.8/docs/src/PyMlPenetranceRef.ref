class PyMlPenetrance
--------------------

.. class:: PyMlPenetrance

   This penetrance operator is a multi-locus Python penetrance
   operator that assigns penetrance values by combining locus and
   genotype specific penetrance values. It differs from a
   :class:`PyPenetrance` in that the python function is responsible
   for penetrance values values for each gentoype type at each locus,
   which can potentially be random, and locus or gentoype-specific.


   .. method:: PyMlPenetrance(func, mode=MULTIPLICATIVE, loci=ALL_AVAIL, ancGens=UNSPECIFIED, output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a penetrance operator that assigns individual affection
      status according to penetrance values combined from locus-
      specific penetrance values that are determined by a Python call-
      back function. The callback function accepts parameter *loc*,
      *alleles* (both optional) and returns location- or genotype-
      specific penetrance values that can be constant or random. The
      penetrance values for each genotype will be cached so the same
      penetrance values will be assigned to genotypes with previously
      assigned values. Note that a function that does not examine the
      genotype naturally assumes a dominant model where genotypes with
      one or two mutants have the same penetrance value. Because
      genotypes at a locus are passed separately and in no particular
      order, this function is also responsible for assigning
      consistent fitness values for genotypes at the same locus (a
      class is usually used). This operator currently ignores
      chromosome types so unused alleles will be passed for loci on
      sex or mitochondrial chromosomes. This operator also ignores the
      phase of genotype so genotypes (a,b) and (b,a) are assumed to
      have the same fitness effect.

      Individual penetrance will be combined in ``ADDITIVE``,
      ``MULTIPLICATIVE``, or ``HETEROGENEITY`` mode from penetrance
      values of loci with at least one non-zero allele (See
      :class:`MlPenetrance` for details).
