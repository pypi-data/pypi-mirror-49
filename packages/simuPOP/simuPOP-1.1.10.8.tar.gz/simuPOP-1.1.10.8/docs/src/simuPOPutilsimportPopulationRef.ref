Function importPopulation
-------------------------


.. function:: importPopulation(format, filename, *args, **kwargs)

   This function import and return a population from a file *filename* in
   specified *format*. Format-specific parameters can be used to define how the
   input should be interpreted and imported. This function supports the following
   file format.
   
   GENEPOP (http://genepop.curtin.edu.au/). For input file of this format, this
   function ignores the first title line, load the second line as loci names,
   and import genotypes of different POP sections as different subpopulations.
   This format accepts the following parameters:
   
   adjust
       Adjust alleles by specified value (default to 0 for no adjustment). This
       parameter is mostly used to convert alleles 1 and 2 in a GenePop file to
       alleles 0 and 1 (with adjust=-1) in simuPOP. Negative allele (e.g. missing
       value 0) will be imported as regular allele with module-dependent values
       (e.g. -1 imported as 255 for standard module).
   
   
   FSTAT (http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/fstat.htm). This format accepts
   the following parameters:
   
   adjust
       Adjust alleles by specified value (default to 0 for no adjustment). This
       parameter is mostly used to convert alleles 1 and 2 in a GenePop file to
       alleles 0 and 1 (with adjust=-1) in simuPOP. Negative allele (e.g. missing
       value 0) will be imported as regular allele with module-dependent values
       (e.g. -1 imported as 255 for standard module).
   
   Phylip (Joseph Felsenstein's Phylip format). This function ignores sequence
   names and import sequences in a haploid (default) or diploid population (if
   there are even number of sequences). An list of allele names are required to
   translate symbols to allele names. This format accepts the following
   parameters:
   
   alleleNames
       Names of alleles 0, 1, 2, ... as a single string (e.g. 'ACTG') or a list of 
       single-character strings (e.g. ['A', 'C', 'T', 'G']). This will be used to
       translate symbols into numeric alleles in simuPOP. Allele names will continue
       to be used as allele names of the returned population.
   
   ploidy
       Ploidy of the returned population, default to 1 (haploid). There should be
       even number of sequences if ploidy=2 (haploid) is specified.
   
   MS (output from Richard R. Hudson's MS or msHOT program). The ms program generates
   npop blocks of nseq haploid chromosomes for command starting with 
   ``ms nsample nrepeat``. By default, the result is imported as a haploid
   population of size nsample. The population will have nrepeat subpopulations
   each with the same number of loci but different number of segregating sites.
   This behavior could be changed by the following parameters:
   
   ploidy
       If ``ploidy`` is set to 2, the sequenences will be paired so the population
       will have ``nseq/2`` individuals. An error will be raised if an odd number
       of sequences are simulated.
       
   mergeBy
       By default, replicate samples will be presented as subpopulations. All
       individuals have the same number of loci but individuals in different
       subpopulations have different segregating sites. If ``mergeBy`` is set
       to ``"chrom"``, the replicates will be presented as separate chromosomes,
       each with a different set of loci determined by segregating sites.
