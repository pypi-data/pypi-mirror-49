.sp
Moves a mount target and its associated export set into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>

The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment to move the mount target to. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new mount target in the specified compartment and subnet. You can associate a file system with a mount target only when they exist in the same availability domain. Instances can connect to mount targets in another availablity domain, but you might see higher latency than with instances in the same availability domain as the mount target.
.sp
Mount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can provide as the host portion of remote target parameters in client mount commands. These private IP addresses are listed in the privateIpIds property of the mount target and are highly available. Mount targets also consume additional IP addresses in their subnet. Do not use /30 or smaller subnets for mount target creation because they do not have sufficient available IP addresses. Allow at least three IP addresses for each mount target.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services resources, including mount targets, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
