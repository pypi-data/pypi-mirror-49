Description: What is Alabaster?
        ==================
        
        Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for the `Sphinx
        <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation system. It is Python 2+3 compatible.
        
        It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately, but as of
        Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency of Sphinx and is selected
        as the default theme.
        
        Live examples of this theme can be seen on `this project's own website
        <http://alabaster.readthedocs.io>`_, `paramiko.org <http://paramiko.org>`_,
        `fabfile.org <http://fabfile.org>`_ and `pyinvoke.org <http://pyinvoke.org>`_.
