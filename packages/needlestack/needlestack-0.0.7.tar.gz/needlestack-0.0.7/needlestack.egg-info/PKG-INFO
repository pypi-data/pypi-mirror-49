        Features
        --------
        
        - gRPC server for kNN vector search
        - Shard vectors over multiple nodes
        - Replicate shard over multiple nodes
        - Retrieve vectors by ID
        
        
        Caveats
        -------
        These are some limitations of the current alpha builds
        
        - Vectors must be sharded and indexed before loading to Needlestack
        - To reload updated vectors, all ``MergerServicer`` and ``SearcherServicer`` nodes must be restarted
        - Vectors must be saved locally to disk for Needlestack to load them
        - Only kNN library supported currently is `Faiss <https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/>`_
        
        
        Next Steps
        ----------
        These are valuable features to make Needlestack usable in production
        
        - Endpoint to index vectors in realtime
        - Update vectors from pre-built data sources without restarting the cluster
        - Allow vectors to be loaded from data sources like S3 or GCS
        - Add support for other kNN libraries
