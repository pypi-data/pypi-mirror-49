Summary: Very lightweight, memory-efficient (uses generator protocol), dependency-free anti-ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Pycopy (https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy). Using this module, one can simplify typical database access operations, without trading well-known SQL for an obscure and inefficient ORM pseudo-language.
