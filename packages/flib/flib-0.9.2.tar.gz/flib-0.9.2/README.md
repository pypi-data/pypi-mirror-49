The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose
[Python](https://www.python.org/) library, which primarily aims to support
[Frootlab](https://github.com/frootlab) projects by serving as a common base
library. It was originally created in 2019 for the [Smart
Analytics](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) project to separate
[Pandora](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora) and
[Nemoa](https://github.com/frootlab/nemoa). The majority of the provided
modules, however, are kept generic to facilitate their application beyond
Frootlab projects as well.

The Frootlab Shared Library is [open
source](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora), based on the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively developed at
[Frootlab](https://github.com/frootlab).
