0.6
- Django Cache Framework instead of custom files-based solution.
  The old way is deprecated. All new writes go to the cache specified.
  Depending on the hash provided read will be done either from cache
  or from the old location.

0.5
- Support Python3 and Django 2.0.x

0.4
- Support (kind of) 1.8 <= Django < 2.0

0.2a
- Add support of m2m relations
- Rejection of bad syntax like this: `instance.<relative_field_name>__draft`. Now you can use the usual - `instance.<related_field>.all()`
