Description: # Threedi-modelchecker
        
        Threedi-modelchecker is a tool to verify the correctness of a 3Di model.
        The goal is to provide a tool for model builders to quickly check if his/her 
        model is correct and can run a 3Di simulation. It provides detailed 
        information about any potential errors in the model.
        
        Threedi-modelchecks works with both spatialite and postgis databases. However, 
        the database should always have the latest 3Di migration: https://docs.3di.lizard.net/en/stable/d_before_you_begin.html#database-overview 
        
        Installation:
        
            pip install threedi-modelchecker
        
        
        Threedi-modelchecker is also integrated into the ThreediToolbox Qgis plugin: https://github.com/nens/ThreeDiToolbox
        
        # Development
        
        A docker image has been created for easy development. It contains an postgis 
        server with an empty 3Di database to allow for easy testing.
        
        Build the image:
        
            docker-compose build
        
        Run the tests:
        
            docker-compose run modelchecker pytest
        
        # Release

            fullrelease
        
        When you create a tag on git, Travis CI automatically creates a new release to [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/threedi-modelchecker/).

        ===================================================
        
        
        0.5 (2019-07-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Retry release (release of 0.4 is missing changes).
        
        
        0.4 (2019-07-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Update to readme.
        - No longer raise a MigrationTooHighError when the migration is larger than expected.
        
        
        0.3 (2019-07-08)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed TypeError with CrossSectionShapeCheck when width/height are `None`.
        - Updated some constraints on CrossSectionShapeCheck:
          - Heights of tabulated shape must be increasing.
          - Egg only requires a width, which must be greater than 0.
        - Added 0 to a valid value for ZoomCategories. Also renamed the ZoomCategories names 
          to something clear names.
        
        
        0.2 (2019-06-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Renamed some methods of ThreediModelChecker.
        - Added basic to the 3di model schema: checks if the model has the latest migration 
          applied and raises an error if not.
        - Rewrote CrossSectionShape check to no longer use regex and added it to config.
        
        
        0.1 (2019-06-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial project structure.
        - Added ORM for a threedi-model in sqlalchemy.
        - Added several types of checks.
        - Manually configured many checks.
        - Added check factories, which generate many checks based on the ORM.
