<div class="cell markdown"><h1 id="Searching-your-book">Searching your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Searching-your-book"> </a></h1><p>It's possible to enable search in your book so that users can find the content
they're looking for. This uses a nifty package called <a href="https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/">lunr.js</a>.</p>
<p>To add search to your book, simple add the following entry to <code>_data/toc.yml</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Search (whatever title you like)</span>
  <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">search</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The result will be a link in your Table of Contents that directs users to a search page.
For example, click the <code>Search</code> link in the TOC of this demo book.</p>
<h2 id="Customizing-how-much-text-is-stored-in-search">Customizing how much text is stored in search<a class="anchor-link" href="#Customizing-how-much-text-is-stored-in-search"> </a></h2><p>The Jupyter-Book search works by storing excerpts of text from each page. This
ensures that the search process itself doesn't take too long. However, it also
means that <em>some</em> of your content will not be searched, because it is past the
cutoff point for the search cache.</p>
<p>To modify the number of words that are indexed in your search, modify the following
field in your <code>_config.yml</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">search_max_words_in_content</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">100</span>  <span class="c1"># Number of words to be indexed per page</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Be careful, if you have many pages, and you use lots of words per page, this can
become very slow!</p>

</div>
