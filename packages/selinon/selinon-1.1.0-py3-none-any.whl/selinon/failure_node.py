r"""Failure node handling representation.

A failure is basically a node in graph, that represents all permutations of possible cases of failures. Consider
having two failure conditions:

.. code-block:: yaml

  failures:
    - nodes:
          - Task1
          - Task2
          - Task3
      fallback:
          - FallbackTask1
    - nodes:
          - Task1
          - Task2
      fallback:
          - FallbackTask2

What we do here, we construct a graph of all possible permutations connected using edges that represent a node
that should be added to create a new permutation:

.. code-block:: yaml

   |-------------------------------
   |                              |
  T1           T2           T3    |
    \         /  \         / \    |
     \       /    \       /   \   |
      \     /      \     /     \  v
       T1,T2*       T2,T3      T1,T3
          \         /           /
           \       /           /
            T1,T2,T3*  <-------

For nodes ``T1,T2,T3`` and ``T1,T2`` we assign a fallback as configured. This graph is then serialized into the Python
configuration code. This way the dispatcher has O(N) time complexity when dealing with failures.

Note we are creating sparse tree - only for nodes that are listed in failures.

Note that we link failure nodes as allocated - we get a one way linked list of all failure nodes that helps us with
Python code generation.
