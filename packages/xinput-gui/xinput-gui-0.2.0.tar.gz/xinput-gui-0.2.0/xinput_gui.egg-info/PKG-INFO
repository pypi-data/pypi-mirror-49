        xinput allows you to edit properties of devices like keyboards, mice, and touchpads. This GUI wraps around the xinput command to make editing them faster and more user-friendly.
        
        ## Installation
        
        xinput-gui depends on Python 3.5+, GTK+ 3.20+, PyGObject, and xinput.
        
        ### Arch Linux
        
        Available as a package on the AUR: [xinput-gui](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xinput-gui)
        
        Install it with `makepkg` or your preferred AUR helper.
        
        ### pip
        
        Available on PyPI: [xinput-gui](https://pypi.org/project/xinput-gui/)
        
        Install it with pip: `pip install --user xinput-gui`.
        
        ### Manual install
        
        Clone this repo and run `./setup.py install --user`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Just run `xinput-gui`. Selecting a device will list all of it's properties. When editing them, changes will be applied immediately.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        xinput-gui is written in Python 3. The GUI uses GTK+ 3 and was made using the Glade interface designer.
        
        Please feel free to open issues with bugs, feature requests, or any other discussion you find necessary.
        
        Pull requests are always welcome, but please make sure that there's an open issue for the bug you're fixing/feature you're adding first. Pull requests that are submitted that haven't already been discussed likely won't be or will take a while to be accepted. This is the kind of tool that can easily become bloated/difficult to use/get out of scope, so I do want to be fairly careful about what features are added.
