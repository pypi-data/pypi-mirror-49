.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new Data Guard association.  A Data Guard association represents the replication relationship between the specified database and a peer database. For more information, see \fI\%Using Oracle Data Guard\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Tasks/usingdataguard.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including Data Guard associations, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-database\-id [text]
.sp
The database \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&. [required]
.SS \-\-database\-admin\-password [text]
.sp
A strong password for the \fISYS\fP, \fISYSTEM\fP, and \fIPDB Admin\fP users to apply during standby creation.
.sp
The password must contain no fewer than nine characters and include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
At least two uppercase characters.
.IP \(bu 2
At least two lowercase characters.
.IP \(bu 2
At least two numeric characters.
.IP \(bu 2
At least two special characters. Valid special characters include "_", "#", and "\-" only.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBThe password MUST be the same as the primary admin password.\fP [required]
.SS \-\-protection\-mode [MAXIMUM_AVAILABILITY|MAXIMUM_PERFORMANCE|MAXIMUM_PROTECTION]
.sp
The protection mode to set up between the primary and standby databases. For more information, see \fI\%Oracle Data Guard Protection Modes\fP <\fBhttp://docs.oracle.com/database/122/SBYDB/oracle-data-guard-protection-modes.htm#SBYDB02000\fP> in the Oracle Data Guard documentation.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT\fP \- The only protection mode currently supported by the Database service is MAXIMUM_PERFORMANCE. [required]
.SS \-\-transport\-type [SYNC|ASYNC|FASTSYNC]
.sp
The redo transport type to use for this Data Guard association.  Valid values depend on the specified \fIprotectionMode\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
MAXIMUM_AVAILABILITY \- SYNC or FASTSYNC * MAXIMUM_PERFORMANCE \- ASYNC * MAXIMUM_PROTECTION \- SYNC

.sp
\fBIMPORTANT\fP \- The only transport type currently supported by the Database service is ASYNC. [required]
.SS \-\-creation\-type [text]
.sp
Specifies whether to create the peer database in an existing DB system or in a new DB system. \fIExistingDbSystem\fP is not supported for creating Data Guard associations for virtual machine DB system databases. [required]
.SS \-\-peer\-db\-system\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the DB System to create the standby database on. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
