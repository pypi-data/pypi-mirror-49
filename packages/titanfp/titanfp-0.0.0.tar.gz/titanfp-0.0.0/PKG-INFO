Description: # Titanic
        
        Titanic is a tool for designing and experimenting
        with novel computer arithmetic formats.
        It builds on the GNU MPFR library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic,
        providing additional support for low-level floating-point behaviors
        such as precise control of rounding and precision tracking.
        
        Titanic uses the [FPCore](http://fpbench.org/spec/)
        benchmark format for floating-point computations.
        Reference interpereters are provided for the FPCore language
        using both [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)
        and [posit](https://posithub.org/index) arithmetics,
        as well as fixed-point.
        These interpreters can also interface with each other
        (and with custom user-defined arithmetics)
        to perform multiple precision, multiple format computations.
