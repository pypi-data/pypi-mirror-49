.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a public IP. Use the \fIlifetime\fP property to specify whether it\(aqs an ephemeral or reserved public IP. For information about limits on how many you can create, see \fI\%Public IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm\fP>\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFor an ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP:\fP You must also specify a \fIprivateIpId\fP with the OCID of the primary private IP you want to assign the public IP to. The public IP is created in the same availability domain as the private IP. An ephemeral public IP must always be assigned to a private IP, and only to the \fIprimary\fP private IP on a VNIC, not a secondary private IP. Exception: If you create a \fI\%NatGateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/NatGateway/\fP>, Oracle automatically assigns the NAT gateway a regional ephemeral public IP that you cannot remove.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFor a reserved public IP:\fP You may also optionally assign the public IP to a private IP by specifying \fIprivateIpId\fP\&. Or you can later assign the public IP with \fI\%UpdatePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/UpdatePublicIp\fP>\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote:\fP When assigning a public IP to a private IP, the private IP must not already have a public IP with \fIlifecycleState\fP = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned.
.sp
Also, for reserved public IPs, the optional assignment part of this operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP to determine if the assignment succeeded.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment to contain the public IP. For ephemeral public IPs, you must set this to the private IP\(aqs compartment OCID. [required]
.SS \-\-lifetime [EPHEMERAL|RESERVED]
.sp
Defines when the public IP is deleted and released back to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public IP pool. For more information, see \fI\%Public IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm\fP>\&. [required]
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-private\-ip\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the private IP to assign the public IP to.
.sp
Required for an ephemeral public IP because it must always be assigned to a private IP (specifically a \fIprimary\fP private IP).
.sp
Optional for a reserved public IP. If you don\(aqt provide it, the public IP is created but not assigned to a private IP. You can later assign the public IP with \fI\%UpdatePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/UpdatePublicIp\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|ASSIGNING|ASSIGNED|UNASSIGNING|UNASSIGNED|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
