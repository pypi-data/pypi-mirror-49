Transmission: A tool for inferring symbiont transmission mode from metagenomic data
===================================================================================

Installation
------------

Install r package abc in the usual way, then install Transmission with

``pip install transmission-popgen``

Generating simulated summary statistics
---------------------------------------

This is a big job and I find it helpful to farm this job out to a
computing cluster. The main program is written for interactive use in a
notebook or shell, so to that end, the cli tool
``transmission-priorgen`` is included with transmission. Use
``transmission-priorgen --help`` for details on available options.

Natively
~~~~~~~~

For example:

::

   transmission-priorgen -n 10 -d 5 -M 2 -s 100 \
       -p '{"eta": (0, 0.1), "tau":(1, 1), "rho"(10, 10)}' \
       --h_opts '{"bias": False}' outfile.pickle

Using the Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a docker image available to use the command line tools as well
as to launch a Jupyter notebook server. It can be found
`here <https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/mpjuers/transmission>`__.
The most recent push to master is tagged ``latest``, however it is
probably desirable to use explicit version numbers for reproducibility.

To generate priors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   docker run --rm -v </path/to/host/directory>:/home/jovyan/work \
       mpjuers/transmission:<version> \
       transmission-priorgen [options] /home/jovyan/work/<outfile.pickle>

``--rm`` removes containers you are finished with while ``-v``
(“volume”) binds a directory on the host machine to one on the
container. should be prefixed by ‘v’, e.g. v0.0.3

If you are working on a compute cluster, you might have access to
Singularity rather than Docker. The transition is straightforward:

::

   singularity exec --contain -B </path/to/host/directory>:/home/jovyan/work \
       docker://mpjuers/transmission:<version> \
       transmission-priorgen [options] /home/jovyan/work/<outfile.pickle>

You may or may not need the ``--contain`` flag; I needed because I had
some locally installed python modules that conflicted with those in the
container.

Using the Docker image to run a Jupyter notebook server.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have had some difficulty compiling rpy2 on my platform (MacOS Mojave).
This may or may not still be the case, but if you wish to avoid any
problems associated with setting up transmission on your machine, it is
possible to run a Jupyter server from the Docker image. First, launch
Docker on your machine and then run, e.g.,

::

   docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes \
       -v </path/to/local/dir>a:/home/jovyan/work mpjuers/transmission:<version>

Omit ``-e JUPYTER_ENEABLE_LAB=yes`` if you are going to use a vanilla
notebook rather than Jupyter Lab. Then you can just open
``<hostname>:8888/`` in a browser and enter the token that appears in
the terminal and anything saved to ``~/work`` on the container will
appear in ``</path/to/local/dir>`` (and vice-versa). For more
