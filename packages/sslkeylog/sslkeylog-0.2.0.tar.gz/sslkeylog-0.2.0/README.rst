This is an implementation of the ``SSLKEYLOGFILE`` facility, available in Firefox and
Chromium/Google Chrome, that is supported by Wireshark in order to decrypt SSL/TLS connections
even when you don't have the private key, or when using key exchange methods that will prevent
decryption even if you do (Such as Diffie-Hellman).

This is for the standard library ``ssl`` module, it won't work for other ssl modules.

Quick Start
-----------
.. code-block:: python

    import sslkeylog

    sslkeylog.set_keylog("sslkeylog.txt")

    # Do anything involving SSL (Using the built-in ssl module)

And set "(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename" in Wireshark's SSL protocol preferences to the resulting
file.
