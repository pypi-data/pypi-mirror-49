Mockify
=======

Mocking library for Python inspired by Google Mock C++ mocking toolkit.

About
-----

The purpose of using Mockify is the same as for Python's ``unittest.mock``
module - to mimic behaviour of things during testing. But Mockify uses a
different approach to do that.

Mockify does not have multiple ``assert_called_*`` methods that are executed to
check if a method was called. Instead, it uses ``expect_call`` method to record
expectations on mocks *before* they are called, and after unit under test is
executed, mocks are checked if all recorded expectations are satisfied using
one ``assert_satisfied`` assertion method.
