        ## Summary:
        
        I made Subshare since I couldn't find a suitable linux alternative for ShareX, which I used on Windows to capture my screenshots, share text and files after it would upload them to the respective servies. Eg: Nextcloud/Hastebin. So I made something to fit my needs. If there are issues feel free to open up a issue and I'll try to get it fixed. Better yet write some come and help a brotha out? :D
        
        ## Installation:
        Subshare is available on PyPi and can be installed with ```pip```    
        
        https://pypi.org/project/subshare/  
        
        ```pip3 install --user subshare```  
        
        ## Requirements
        Linux: ```escrotum```
        - Scrot displayed artifacts when using selection mode. Escrotum fixed this.
        
        ## Configuration
        The default config file is created on the first run on ```subshare``` at ```~/.subshare.conf``` and concaints the following.
        
        ```
        "nextcloud_url": "",
        "nextcloud_dir": "",
        "nextcloud_username": "",
        "nextcloud_password": "",
        "use_polr": "true/false - NO QUOTES",
        "polr_url": "",
        "polr_api_key": "",
        "hastebin_url": "h",
        "screenshot_save_dir": "/home/USERNAME/screenshots/"
        ```
        Enter all your respective details and a true or false for if you want to use Polr to shorten the links or not.
        
        
        ## Usage
        Note: All commands will automatically copy the link to your clipboard.
        
        - Sharing screenshots:  
        ```subshare screenshot``` captures a regular screenshot.  
        ``` subshare screenshot -t selection``` lets you drag out a selection.  
        
        - Sharing text:  
        ```subshare text -f /path/to/file``` will post the contents of the file to Hastebin.  
        
        - Sharing files:  
        ```subshare file -f /path/to/file``` upload the file to your nextcloud instance.  
        
        - Shortening links:  
        ```subshare link -f "LINK TO SHORTEN"``` will shorten the link you specify. Dont forget the quotes around it.  
        
        
        ## To-do:
        
        [x] Make Polr optional.  
        [] Add alternative providers for uploading and sharing links...  
        [] idk it pretty much does what I wanted rn. Feel free to make a pull request or open up an issue if you'd like anything added and we'll see what we can do.
