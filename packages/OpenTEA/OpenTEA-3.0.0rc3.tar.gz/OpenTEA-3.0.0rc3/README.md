Welcome to the OpenTEA GUI Engine! This is a simple guide for
installation. For more, see the documentation [online](http://cerfacs.fr/opentea/).


## Before you start

There are a couple of dependancies with OpenTEA 3.X, namely:

  - python 3.6+ but not 3.X
  - numpy v1.10 or higher
  - scipy v0.15 or higher
  - h5py v2.6 or higher

OpenTEA is tasked with executing locally and on distant servers many shell
commands. This process is guaranteed only for the `bash` shell in OpenTEA
to date.

The installation is described for an installation with everything in your
home directory `~/`. Please adapt according to your needs and permissions.

## OpenTEA command-line tools

Some tools a provided by OpenTEA through command line

- `opentea_test_schema file.yaml` is testing the consistency of a SCHEMA structure stored in YAML (.yml, .yaml) or JSON (.json) with respect to the requirements of opentea services.
