## Introduction

`flowws` is an in-development framework for building modular, reusable
task workflows. The core library contains tools to abstract over
storage locations and parse arguments in a uniform way for both python
scripts and command-line-based execution.

`flowws` is being developed in conjunction with
[hoomd-flowws](https://github.com/klarh/hoomd_flowws), which
implements a set of flowws modules for use with
[hoomd-blue](https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue).

## Installation
