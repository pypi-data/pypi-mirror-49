.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A link between a DRG and VCN. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Attaches the specified DRG to the specified VCN. A VCN can be attached to only one DRG at a time, and vice versa. The response includes a \fIDrgAttachment\fP object with its own OCID. For more information about DRGs, see \fI\%Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRGs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingDRGs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the attachment, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, the DRG attachment is automatically placed into the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.

The OCID of the DRG. [required]
.SS \-\-vcn\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the VCN. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-route\-table\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the route table the DRG attachment will use.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a route table here, the DRG attachment is created without an associated route table. The Networking service does NOT automatically associate the attached VCN\(aqs default route table with the DRG attachment.
.sp
For information about why you would associate a route table with a DRG attachment, see \fI\%Advanced Scenario: Transit Routing\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ATTACHING|ATTACHED|DETACHING|DETACHED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.SS delete
.SS Description
.sp
Detaches a DRG from a VCN by deleting the corresponding \fIDrgAttachment\fP\&. This is an asynchronous operation. The attachment\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will change to DETACHING temporarily until the attachment is completely removed.
