Logarithmic axes

Logarithmic axes are quite similar to linear axes and differ only in a very few
properties, namely a non-linear mapping of values to axis positions. They also
have different default partitioners and raters (see below). ... While the
partitioner really is quite different - it implements a logarithmic positioning
of the ticks - the rater just alters some defaults in favour of using more
subticks to improve the visualization of the logarithmic nature of the axis.

! Besides presenting a standard logarithmic axis, we also show you how to alter
the base used by the logarithmic axis. Since the functionality of a logarithmic
axis is independent of the base, all we need to adjust are the components for
creating ticks (see `log2parter`) and the texts for the labels (see
`log2texter`). More details about the parters and texters components are given
below in the corresponding examples.
