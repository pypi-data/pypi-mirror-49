Description: This Python package shall facilitate the evaluation of the predictions of machine learning algorithms. In the current version, there are only two
        functions in the package. For both regression and classification algorithms there is a function called "summary", which takes the true values for the
        dependent variable and the respective predictions as an input. It returns a thorough overview of the performance including the most common metrics.
        This allows a quick analysis in order to determine the performance of the algorithm.# easy_evaluation
