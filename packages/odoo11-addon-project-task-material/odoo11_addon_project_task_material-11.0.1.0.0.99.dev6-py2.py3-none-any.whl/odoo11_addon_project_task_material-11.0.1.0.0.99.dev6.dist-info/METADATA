======================
Project Task Material
======================

Project Tasks allow to record the time spent on them, but some activities
often require you to keep a record of the material used also.

This module offers the ability to keep track of that material.

Note that only a simple record is made and no accounting or stock moves are
actually performed.

Usage
=====

To use this module:

Every task form has a tab where product and their quantities can be added.
