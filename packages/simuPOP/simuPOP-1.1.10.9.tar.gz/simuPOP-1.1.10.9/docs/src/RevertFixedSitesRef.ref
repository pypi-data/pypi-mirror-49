class RevertFixedSites
----------------------

.. class:: RevertFixedSites

   This operator checks all or specified loci of a population and
   revert all mutants at loci to wildtype alleles if they are fixed in
   the population. If a list of (virtual) subpopulations are
   specified, alleles are reverted if they are fixed in each
   subpopulation, regardless if the alleles are fixed in other
   subpopulations.


   .. method:: RevertFixedSites(loci=ALL_AVAIL, output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=["ind_id"])


      Create an operator to set all alleles to zero at specified
      (parameter *loci*) or all loci if they are fixed (having one
      non-zero allele) at these loci. If parameter *subPops* are
      specified, only individuals in these subpopulations are
      considered.
