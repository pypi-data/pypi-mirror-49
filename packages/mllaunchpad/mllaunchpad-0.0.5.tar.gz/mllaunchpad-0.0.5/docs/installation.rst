Installation
==============================================================================


Stable release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install ML Launchpad, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv install mllaunchpad

Or, if don't use pipenv (why not? It's awesome! ðŸ˜€):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install mllaunchpad

These two are the preferred methods for installing ML Launchpad, as they will
always install the most recent stable release.

We recommend using `pipenv`_ for installing and uninstalling mllaunchpad
and other packages in your project. It automatically manages a
project-folder-level virtual environment and tracks your project's
requirements for you.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
