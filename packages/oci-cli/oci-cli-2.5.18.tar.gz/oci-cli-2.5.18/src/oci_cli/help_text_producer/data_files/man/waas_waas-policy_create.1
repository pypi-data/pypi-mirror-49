.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy in the specified compartment. A WAAS policy must be established before creating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules. To use WAF rules, your web application\(aqs origin servers must defined in the \fIWaasPolicy\fP schema.
.sp
A domain name must be specified when creating a WAAS policy. The domain name should be different from the origins specified in your \fIWaasPolicy\fP\&. Once domain name is entered and stored, it is unchangeable.
.sp
Use the record data returned in the \fIcname\fP field of the \fIWaasPolicy\fP object to create a CNAME record in your DNS configuration that will direct your domain\(aqs traffic through the WAF.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the service to reside. For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a display name and domain for the WAAS policy. The display name does not have to be unique and can be changed. The domain name should be different from every origin specified in \fIWaasPolicy\fP\&.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including WAAS policies, receive a unique, Oracle\-assigned ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When a resource is created, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a list API operation for that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP After sending the POST request, the new object\(aqs state will temporarily be \fICREATING\fP\&. Ensure that the resource\(aqs state has changed to \fIACTIVE\fP before use.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment in which to create the WAAS policy. [required]
.SS \-\-domain [text]
.sp
The web application domain that the WAAS policy protects. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the WAAS policy. The name is can be changed and does not need to be unique.
.SS \-\-additional\-domains [complex type]
.sp
An array of additional domains for the specified web application.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-origins [complex type]
.sp
A map of host to origin for the web application. The key should be a customer friendly name for the host, ex. primary, secondary, etc.
.sp
This option is a JSON dictionary of type dict(str, Origin).  For documentation on Origin please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/waas/20181116/datatypes/Origin\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
A simple key\-value pair without any defined schema.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
A key\-value pair with a defined schema that restricts the values of tags. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
