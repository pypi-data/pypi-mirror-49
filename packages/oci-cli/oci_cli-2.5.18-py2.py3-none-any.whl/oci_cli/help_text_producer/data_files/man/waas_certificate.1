.SS Description
.sp
Allows an SSL certificate to be added to a WAAS policy. The Web Application Firewall terminates SSL connections to inspect requests in runtime, and then re\-encrypts requests before sending them to the origin for fulfillment.
.sp

.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment in which to create the SSL certificate. [required]
.SS \-\-certificate\-data [text]
.sp
The data of the SSL certificate. [required]
.SS \-\-private\-key\-data [text]
.sp
The private key of the SSL certificate. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the SSL certificate. The name can be changed and does not need to be unique.
.SS \-\-is\-trust\-verification\-disabled [boolean]
.sp
Set to true if the SSL certificate is self\-signed.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
A simple key\-value pair without any defined schema.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
A key\-value pair with a defined schema that restricts the values of tags. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|FAILED|UPDATING|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
