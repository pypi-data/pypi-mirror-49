## Background

Makefiles provide a simple interface, `make <command>`, that is great for automating repetitive project tasks. Makefile syntax, however, is archaic, error-prone, and ill-suited for constructing modern, useful command-line interfaces.

Python, on the other hand, has wonderful syntax and is _great_ for scripting. When Python is paired with [Click] constructing modern, useful command-line interfaces is easy!

Is there a way we can combine the power of Python and Click into a "Makefile like" experience?

_Enter Klak_.

Klak exposes a single entry-point—`klak`—which auto-loads a _100%_, vanilla Python file called a **Clickfile**. All CLI is built using standard Python and Click, and all commands are available via: `klak <command>` (see [Usage](#usage)).

### What is it good for?

Klak's purpose is to provide a convenient, single-file experince for automating repetitive project tasks. It does not, nor will it ever, intend to replace Make or Makefiles.

## Install

### Stable Release

```bash
# NOTE: This is the recommended method of installation.
pip install klak
```

### From Source

> Klak uses [Poetry] to manage depdencies and distribution (in lieu of setuptools).

```bash
# NOTE: Clone the public repository
git clone git://github.com/aubricus/klak

# NOTE: or download the tarball
curl  -OL https://github.com/aubricus/klak/tarball/master

# NOTE: Once the source is downloaded
poetry install
```

## Usage

To get started with Klak create a **Clickfile**. Here's a simple **Clickfile** to get started:

```python
"""
Example Clickfile.

NOTE: Set your editor's language mode to Python to
      enable syntax highlighting! :^)
"""

import logging
import click
from klak.cli import cli


log = logging.getLogger("Clickfile")


# -------------------------------------
# Examples
# -------------------------------------

# Example: Add a command.
@cli.command()
@click.argument("name")
def greet(name):
    """Greet someone."""
    click.secho(f"Hello, {name}")


# Example: Add a group and sub-command.
@cli.group()
def humans():
    """Humans command group."""
    pass


@humans.command(name="count")
def humans_count():
    """Count all the humans."""
    click.secho("Over 9000!!!")

```

**NOTE**: You can also organize commands into a python package in the same directory. See [Klak/Pull/229](https://github.com/aubricus/klak/pull/229).

Once your **Clickfile** is ready, access commands through `klak`.

```bash
$ klak --help
```
