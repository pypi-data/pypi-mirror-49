.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new mount target in the specified compartment and subnet. You can associate a file system with a mount target only when they exist in the same availability domain. Instances can connect to mount targets in another availablity domain, but you might see higher latency than with instances in the same availability domain as the mount target.
.sp
Mount targets have one or more private IP addresses that you can provide as the host portion of remote target parameters in client mount commands. These private IP addresses are listed in the privateIpIds property of the mount target and are highly available. Mount targets also consume additional IP addresses in their subnet. Do not use /30 or smaller subnets for mount target creation because they do not have sufficient available IP addresses. Allow at least three IP addresses for each mount target.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services resources, including mount targets, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-availability\-domain [text]
.sp
The availability domain in which to create the mount target.
.sp
Example: \fIUocm:PHX\-AD\-1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment in which to create the mount target. [required]
.SS \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the subnet in which to create the mount target. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIMy mount target\fP
.SS \-\-hostname\-label [text]
.sp
The hostname for the mount target\(aqs IP address, used for DNS resolution. The value is the hostname portion of the private IP address\(aqs fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, \fIfiles\-1\fP in the FQDN \fIfiles\-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com\fP\&. Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with \fI\%RFC 952\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952\fP> and \fI\%RFC 1123\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123\fP>\&.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fIfiles\-1\fP
.SS \-\-ip\-address [text]
.sp
A private IP address of your choice. Must be an available IP address within the subnet\(aqs CIDR. If you don\(aqt specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet.
.sp
Example: \fI10.0.3.3\fP
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair  with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED|FAILED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
