.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Use \fICaptureConsoleHistory\fP to request the capture of up to a megabyte of the most recent console history. This call returns a \fIConsoleHistory\fP object. The object will have a state of REQUESTED. 2. Wait for the capture operation to succeed by polling \fIGetConsoleHistory\fP with the identifier of the console history metadata. The state of the \fIConsoleHistory\fP object will go from REQUESTED to GETTING\-HISTORY and then SUCCEEDED (or FAILED). 3. Use \fIGetConsoleHistoryContent\fP to get the actual console history data (not the metadata). 4. Optionally, use \fIDeleteConsoleHistory\fP to delete the console history metadata and the console history data.

To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the \fIsourceDetails\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet\(aqs CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic\fP> with the VNIC ID.

A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

The default iPXE script connects to the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
