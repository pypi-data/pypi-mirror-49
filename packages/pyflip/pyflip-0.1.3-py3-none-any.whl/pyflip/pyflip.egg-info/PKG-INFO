Description: PyFlip is a simple and modern library for Linear and Integer Programming in Python 3, offering an API to advanced solvers.
        A major focus is features which speed up the model development process, e.g. prototyping, debugging, profiling, and integrating with metaheuristic algorithms.
        This project has been written from scratch in 2018, having been inspired by PuLP, CyLP, rust-lp-modeler, and JuMP.
