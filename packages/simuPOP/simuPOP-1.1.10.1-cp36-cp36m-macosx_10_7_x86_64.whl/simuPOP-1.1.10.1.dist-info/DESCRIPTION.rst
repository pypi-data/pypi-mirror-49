simuPOP is a forward-time population genetics simulation environment.
The core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides
a large number of objects and functions to manipulate populations,
and a mechanism to evolve populations forward in time. Using this
R/Splus-like environment, users can create, manipulate and evolve
populations interactively, or write a script and run it as a batch
file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design, simuPOP can simulate
large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At a more
user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in
scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic
population genetics models to generating datasets under complex
evolutionary scenarios.
