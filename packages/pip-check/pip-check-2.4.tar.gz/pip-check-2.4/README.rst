pip-check
=========

pip-check gives you a quick overview of all installed packages and their
update status. Under the hood it calls ``pip list --outdated --format=columns``
and transforms it into a more user friendly table.

.. important:: Requires ``pip`` Version 9 or higher!

Installation::

    pip install pip-check


Usage::

    $ pip-check

    # If your terminal does not support the table lines,
    # you can show an ASCII table:
    $ pip-check --ascii

    # You can specify the pip executable:
    $ pip-check --cmd=pip3

    # List only packages that are not dependencies of installed packages:
    $ pip-check --not-required

    # Some packages have ridiculous long versions. To show them:
    $ pip-check --full-version

    # Do not show packages where their version is up to date:
    $ pip-check --hide-unchanged

    # Show only packages which were installed in the user space:
    $ pip-check --user

    # Do not show packages that are installed outside the current virtualenv:
    $ pip-check --local
