Description: 
        Pymongo_import is a program that can parse a csv file from its header and first line to
        create an automated type conversion file (a .ff file) to control how types in the CSV
        file are converted. This file can be edited once created (it is a ConfigParser format file).
        For types that fail conversion the type conversion will fail back on string conversion.
        Blank columns in the CSV file are marked as [blank-0], [blank-1] ... [blank-n] and are ignored
        by the parser.
