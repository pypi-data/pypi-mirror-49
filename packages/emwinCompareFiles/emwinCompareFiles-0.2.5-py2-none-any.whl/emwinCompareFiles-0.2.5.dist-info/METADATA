# CompareFiles 
v0.2.5

Compare Files provides a way to compare latency and count products,
between two systems with incoming data. In this case, we are comparing
the ingested products on the ESB between legacy and enterprise.
A file from the legacy system is is downloaded via GoogleDrive and 
the enterprise file is created from querying the edpdb database. 
Both files are CSV.

Typical usage often looks like this::

    python database_query.py
    python compare_files.py

Input
==============
* Dates for querying the database in the format MM-DD-YYYY
* Name of datafile from legacy system


Prerequisites
==============
* Connection to the current host: {username}@nco-lw-{username}.ncep.noaa.gov

* Python 2.7 

* Download legacy file from GoogleDrive: 
  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dXkpZ4LxmS_6Sah7GheAnwAZmj7727Fp

* Download AWDS file from GoogleDrive: 
  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NP6d3GnNdw4UoWF7-aJlSy8saKwE9sBW

* Install module psycopg2 
  http://initd.org/psycopg/

* Other modules needed: csv, datetime, re, and time

Output
-------------
1. Latency.csv
2. LegacyProductsNotInEnterprise.csv
