.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An NFS file system. To allow access to a file system, add it to an export set and associate the export set with a mount target. The same file system can be in multiple export sets and associated with multiple mount targets.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Moves a file system and its associated snapshots into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>

The OCID of the file system. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment to move the file system to. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and availability domain. Instances can mount file systems in another availability domain, but doing so might increase latency when compared to mounting instances in the same availability domain.
.sp
After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount target. Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the mount target\(aqs IP address. You can associate a file system with more than one mount target at a time.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including file systems, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type or by viewing the resource in the Console.
