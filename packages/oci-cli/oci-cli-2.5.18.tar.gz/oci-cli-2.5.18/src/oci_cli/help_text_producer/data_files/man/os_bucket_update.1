.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-bucket\-name, \-\-name, \-bn [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: \fImy\-new\-bucket1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The compartmentId for the compartment to which the bucket is targeted to move to.
.SS \-\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Arbitrary string, up to 4KB, of keys and values for user\-defined metadata.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-public\-access\-type [NoPublicAccess|ObjectRead|ObjectReadWithoutList]
.sp
The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to \fINoPublicAccess\fP by default, which only allows an authenticated caller to access the bucket and its contents. When \fIObjectRead\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP, \fIHeadObject\fP, and \fIListObjects\fP operations. When \fIObjectReadWithoutList\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP and \fIHeadObject\fP operations.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: 
.nf
\(ga
.fi
{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-kms\-key\-id [text]
.sp
A KMS key OCID that will be associated with the given bucket. If it is empty the Update operation will actually remove the KMS key, if there is one, from the given bucket. Note that the old kms key should still be enbaled in KMS otherwise all the objects in the bucket encrypted with the old KMS key will no longer be accessible.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to match. For creating and committing a multipart upload to an object, this is the entity tag of the target object. For uploading a part, this is the entity tag of the target part.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
