.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A collection of users who all need the same type of access to a particular set of resources or compartment. For conceptual information about groups and other IAM Service components, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
If you\(aqre federating with an identity provider (IdP), you need to create mappings between the groups defined in the IdP and groups you define in the IAM service. For more information, see \fI\%Identity Providers and Federation\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm\fP>\&. Also see \fI\%IdentityProvider\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/IdentityProvider/\fP> and \fI\%IdpGroupMapping\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/IdpGroupMapping/\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new group in your tenancy.
.sp
You must specify your tenancy\(aqs OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the group, which must be unique across all groups in your tenancy and cannot be changed. You can use this name or the OCID when writing policies that apply to the group. For more information about policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the group (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Group/UpdateGroup\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
After creating the group, you need to put users in it and write policies for it. See \fI\%AddUserToGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup\fP> and \fI\%CreatePolicy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Policy/CreatePolicy\fP>\&.
