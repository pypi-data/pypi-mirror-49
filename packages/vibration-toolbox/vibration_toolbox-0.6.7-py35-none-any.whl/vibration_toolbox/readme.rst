Please refer to the `Numpy standards for docstrings <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_.

Specifically note:

1. Parameters should be listed similarly to:

|    filename : str
|    copy : bool
|    dtype : data-type
|    iterable : iterable object
|    shape : int or tuple of int
|    files : list of str
|    time : array_like

2. First line should be inline with the ``"""`` and brief enough to fit on one line.

3. There must be a blank line after the first line.

This is not exhaustive. It just highlights some consistent errors made.
