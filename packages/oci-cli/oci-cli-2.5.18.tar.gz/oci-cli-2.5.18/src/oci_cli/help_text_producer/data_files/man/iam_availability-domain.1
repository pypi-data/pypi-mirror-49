.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
One or more isolated, fault\-tolerant Oracle data centers that host cloud resources such as instances, volumes, and subnets. A region contains several Availability Domains. For more information, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&.
.SH AVAILABLE COMMANDS

.UNINDENT
.SS list
.SS Description
.sp
Lists the availability domains in your tenancy. Specify the OCID of either the tenancy or another of your compartments as the value for the compartment ID (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). See \fI\%Where to Get the Tenancy\(aqs OCID and User\(aqs OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five\fP>\&. Note that the order of the results returned can change if availability domains are added or removed; therefore, do not create a dependency on the list order.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). If not provided, this parameter will use the tenancy from the config file.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
