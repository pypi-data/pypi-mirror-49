PyX - Python graphics package
=============================

PyX is a Python package for the creation of PostScript and PDF files. It
combines an abstraction of the PostScript drawing model with a TeX/LaTeX
interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in publication-ready quality are
built out of these primitives.

Installation
------------

The installation of PyX is described in the file INSTALL.

Documentation
-------------

A prebuilt version of the manual can be found on the PyX webpage under
https://pyx-project.org/manual.pdf. For answers to frequently asked
questions, we refer to https://pyx-project.org/pyxfaq.pdf. We also recommend
taking a look on the nice examples for the use of PyX, which can be found in
the examples directory.
