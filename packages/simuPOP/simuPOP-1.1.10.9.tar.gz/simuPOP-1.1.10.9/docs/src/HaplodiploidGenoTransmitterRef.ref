class HaplodiploidGenoTransmitter
---------------------------------

.. class:: HaplodiploidGenoTransmitter

   A genotype transmitter (during-mating operator) for haplodiploid
   populations. The female parent is considered as diploid and the
   male parent is considered as haploid (only the first homologous
   copy is valid). If the offspring is ``FEMALE``, she will get a
   random copy of two homologous chromosomes of her mother, and get
   the only paternal copy from her father. If the offspring is
   ``MALE``, he will only get a set of chromosomes from his mother.


   .. method:: HaplodiploidGenoTransmitter(output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a haplodiploid genotype transmitter (during-mating
      operator) that transmit parental genotypes from parents to
      offspring in a haplodiploid population. Parameters *subPops* and
      *infoFields* are ignored. This operator also copies allelic
      lineage when it is executed in a module with lineage allele
      type.
