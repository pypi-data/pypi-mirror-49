# img2vid Utility Tool

img2vid pads, resizes and transcodes arbitrary image data into the h264 NV12
format, thereby making it fit for decoding by NVIDIA's codecs.

img2vid is licensed GPLv2 only because, through FFmpeg, it links to libx264,
which carries the viral GPLv2 license. All other Benzina source code is licensed
MIT.
