You are restricted from reverse engineering, decompiling and disassembling the Software unless an explicit and separate permission is granted by the Licensor.

This software can connect to various third parties servers and services (collectively "Services"), including those of The FXCM Group of companies (collectively, "FXCM").

Do not use Services in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Services.
