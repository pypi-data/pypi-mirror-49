Description: # spin-and-heave  
          
        use lambdaci docker image to package and zip lambda package, then run terraform apply.  
          
        ### usage  
        
        `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project`  
        
        *where "lambda_project" is the directory with your lambda files  
        this will run the lambdaci docker image for the runtime you're using  
        then save the zip file (in this case "lambda_project.zip") in your current  
        working directory*  
          
        `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -s`  
          
        *skip terraform apply*  
          
        `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -js`  
          
        *spin and heave a node lambda package, defaults to nodejs10.x  
        this will run "npm install --production" instead of "pip install"*  
          
        `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -r python3.7`  
          
        *alternatively, use custom runtimes.  
        this has no real use yet...   
        only python and node would be supported thus far*
