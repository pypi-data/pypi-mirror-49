*Curate, visualize, and annotate your behavioral ephys data using Python*

|PyPI badge| |GitHub badge| |Build badge| |Coverage badge|

**neurotic** is an app that allows you to easily review and annotate your
electrophysiology data and simultaneously captured video. It is an easy way to
load your Neo_-compatible data into ephyviewer_ without doing any programming.

You organize your data sets in a YAML file like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my favorite dataset:
        description: This time it actually worked!

        data_dir:           C:/local_dir_containing_files
        remote_data_dir:    http://myserver/remote_dir_containing_downloadable_files  # optional
        data_file:          data.axgx
        video_file:         video.mp4
        # etc

        video_offset: -3.4  # seconds between start of video and data acq
        epoch_encoder_possible_labels:
            - label01
            - label02
        plots:
            - channel: I2
              ylim: [-30, 30]
            - channel: RN
              ylim: [-60, 60]
            # etc

        filters:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - channel: Force
              lowpass: 50
            # etc
        amplitude_discriminators:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - name: B3 neuron
              channel: BN2
              amplitude: [50, 100]
            # etc

Open your file in the app and choose a data set. If the data and video files
aren't already on your local computer, the app can download them for you.
Finally, click launch and the app will use a standard viewer layout to display
your data to you using ephyviewer_.

*(Pictured above is a voracious Aplysia californica making the researcher very
happy.)*

The viewers are easy and intuitive to navigate:

- Pressing the play button will scroll through the data and video in real time,
  or at a higher or lower rate if the speed parameter is changed.
- The arrow/WASD keys allow you to step through time.
- Right-clicking and dragging right or left will contract or expand time to show
  more or less at once.
- Scrolling the mouse wheel in the trace viewer or the video viewer will zoom.
- The "epoch encoder" can be used to block out periods of time during which
  something interesting is happening for later review or further analysis
  (saved to a CSV file).
- All panels can be hidden, undocked, or repositioned on the fly.

Electrophysiologists should still find this tool useful even if they don't need
video synchronization.

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

Because **neurotic** depends on some pre-release changes in a couple libraries,
``pip`` cannot automatically fetch all dependencies during normal installation.
Therefore, **dependencies must be installed manually**.

With conda
~~~~~~~~~~

A recipe for installing **neurotic** via ``conda`` directly is not yet
available. However, the file ``environment.yml`` is provided for installing its
dependencies into a conda environment. To install into a new conda environment
named ``neurotic``, use these commands::

    git clone https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
    conda env create -f neurotic/environment.yml -n neurotic

To update an existing environment, replace ``conda env create`` with ``conda
env update``.

Remember to switch environments if necessary before proceeding with
installation (``conda activate neurotic`` or ``source activate neurotic``).

Without conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file ``requirements.txt`` is provided for installing dependencies with
``pip``. Dependencies can be installed using these commands::

    git clone https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
    pip install -U -r neurotic/requirements.txt

If you get an error while installing PyAV, especially on Windows, you may need
to build it from scratch or get it from another source, such as conda-forge::

    conda install -c conda-forge av

Installing neurotic
-------------------

To reiterate, you must install dependencies manually. They will not be
installed with **neurotic**.

To install the latest release version from PyPI_, use ::

    pip install neurotic

To install the latest development version from GitHub_, use ::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git

To install from a local copy of the source code, use ::

    python setup.py install

Getting started
---------------

Launch the standalone app from the command line::

    neurotic

A simple example is provided. Select the "example dataset", download the
associated data, and then click launch.

Command line arguments can be listed using ::

    neurotic --help
