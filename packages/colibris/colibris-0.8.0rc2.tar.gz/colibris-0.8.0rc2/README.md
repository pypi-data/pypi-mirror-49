## Starting Your Project

The following variables are assumed:

 * `VENVS` - the folder where you keep your python virtual environments (e.g. `~/.local/share/virtualenvs`)
 * `PROJECT_NAME` - the name of your project (e.g. `my-project`) 
 * `PROJECTS_DIR` - the folder where you keep your projects (e.g. `~/Projects`)
 * `PACKAGE` - the name of your main project's package 
 * `VERSION` - the version of your project

Create a virtual environment for your new project:

    virtualenv ${VENVS}/${PROJECT_NAME} && source ${VENVS}/${PROJECT_NAME}/bin/activate

Install `colibris`:

    pip install colibris
    
(For mac users) Install gnu sed:

    brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names

Go to your projects folder:

    cd ${PROJECTS_DIR}

Prepare the project:

    colibris-start-project ${PROJECT_NAME}

You can use a different skeleton template repository for your project:

    colibris-start-project ${PROJECT_NAME} --skeleton git@github.com:myorganization/microservice-skeleton.git 

Your project folder will contain a package derived from your project name as well as various other stuff. You'll find
a `manage.py` module in the project package, which is in fact the main script of your project.

You'll also find a `settings.py` module that you'll want to edit to adapt it to your project's needs.

The commands in this document assume you're in your project folder and you have your virtual environment correctly
sourced, unless otherwise specified.


## Database

Choose a backend for the database, by setting the `DATABASE` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. By default, no
database is enabled and the persistence layer is disabled.

#### SQLite Backend

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    DATABASE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.persist.SQLiteBackend',
        'name': '/path/to/yourproject.db'
    }

#### MySQL Backend

Make sure to have the `mysqldb` or `pymysql` python package installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    DATABASE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.persist.MySQLBackend',
        'name': 'yourproject',
        'host': '127.0.0.1',
        'port': 3316,
        'username': 'username',
        'password': 'password'
    }

#### PostgreSQL Backend

Make sure to have the `psycopg2-binary` python package installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    DATABASE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.persist.PostgreSQLBackend',
        'name': 'yourproject',
        'host': '127.0.0.1',
        'port': 5432,
        'username': 'username',
        'password': 'password'
    }


## Models

Add your models by editing the `models.py` file:

    nano ${PACKAGE}/models.py 


## Schemas

Add your schemas by editing the `schemas.py` file:

    nano ${PACKAGE}/schemas.py 


## Views

Add your views by editing the `views.py` file:

    nano ${PACKAGE}/views.py
    
### APIView

For a simple API view, `colibris.views.APIView` can be used. Here is an example:

    class ItemsView(APIView):
        body_schema_class = ItemSchema
        query_schema_class = QuerySchema
    
        async def get(self):
            args = await self.get_validated_query()
    
            return web.json_response(args)
    
        async def post(self):
            data = await self.get_validated_body()
    
            return web.json_response(data)


Where `ItemSchema` and `QuerySchema` are simple [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/quickstart.html#declaring-schemas)
schemas.

### ModelView

For a model based view, there is `colibris.views.ModelView` which has to be used together with at least one of:
`ListMixin`, `CreateMixin`, `RetrieveMixin`, `UpdateMixin`, `DestroyMixin`. Here is an example of a model view 
which supports `GET` and `POST` methods:

    class ItemsView(ModelView, ListMixin, CreateMixin):
        model = Model 
        body_schema_class = ItemSchema
        query_schema_class = QuerySchema

For a basic RESTful resource there are predefined base views that can be sed like this:

    class ItemsView(ListCreateModelView):
        model = Model 
        body_schema_class = ItemSchema
        
    class ItemsDetailView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyModelView):
        model = Model 
        body_schema_class = ItemSchema

## Routes

Associate URL paths to views by editing the `routes.py` file: 

    nano ${PACKAGE}/routes.py
    
If you need routes for static files (not recommended for production), add your static prefix/path associations to
`STATIC_ROUTES`.


## Authentication

Choose a backend for the authentication by setting the `AUTHENTICATION` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. By
default, a null backend is used which associates each request with a dummy account.

#### JWT Backend

Make sure to have the `pyjwt` python package installed. 

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    AUTHENTICATION = {
        'backend': 'colibris.authentication.jwt.JWTBackend',
        'model': 'yourproject.models.User',
        'identity_claim': 'sub',
        'identity_field': 'username',
        'secret_field': 'password',
        'cookie_name': 'auth_token',
        'cookie_domain': 'example.com',
        'validity_seconds': 3600 * 24 * 30
    }
    
The `cookie_name` property is optional and tells the backend to look for the token in cookies as well, in addition to
the `Authorization` header.

The `cookie_domain` property is optional and configures the cookie domain.

The `validity_seconds` property is optional and configures the given validity for the token.

#### API Key Backend

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    AUTHENTICATION = {
        'backend': 'colibris.authentication.apikey.APIKeyBackend',
        'model': 'yourproject.models.User',
        'key_field': 'secret',
    }


## Authorization

Choose a backend for the authorization by setting the `AUTHORIZATION` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. By default,
a null backend is used, allowing everybody to perform any request.

#### Role Backend

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    AUTHORIZATION = {
        'backend': 'colibris.authorization.role.RoleBackend',
        'role_field': 'role'
    }

#### Rights Backend

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    AUTHORIZATION = {
        'backend': 'colibris.authorization.rights.RightsBackend',
        'model': 'yourproject.models.Right',
        'account_field': 'user',
        'resource_field': 'resource',
        'operation_field': 'operation'
    }


## Migrations

#### Create Migrations

To create migrations for your model changes, use:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py makemigrations

You can optionally specify a name for your migrations:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py makemigrations somename

#### Apply Migrations

To apply migrations on the currently configured database, use:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py migrate


## Web Server

Start the web server by running:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py runserver

Then you can test it by pointing your browser to:

    http://localhost:8888


## App Initialization

You can add project-specific initialization code in the `init` function exposed by `app.py`:

    nano ${PACKAGE}/app.py


## Cache

The caching mechanism is configured via the `CACHE` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. Caching is disabled by
default.

#### Usage

To use the caching mechanism, just import it wherever you need it:

    from colibris import cache
    
To set a value, use `set`:

    cache.set('my_key', my_value, lifetime=300)

Later, you can get your value back:

    my_value = cache.get('my_key', default='some_default')

You can invalidate a key using `delete`:

    cache.delete('my_key')

#### Redis Backend

Make sure to have the `redis` python package installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    CACHE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.cache.redis.RedisBackend',
        'host': '127.0.0.1',
        'port': 6379,
        'db': 0,
        'password': 'yourpassword'
    }


## Templates

The templates mechanism is configured via the `TEMPLATE` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. Templates are disabled by
default.

#### Search Paths

The template files should live in a folder called `templates`, in your project's package directory. If you want them
to be searched for in other folders, just add those paths to the `paths` template setting.

#### Basic Usage

To use the templating mechanism, just import it wherever you need it:

    from colibris import template
    
To render a template file, simply call the `render` function and specify context as keyword arguments:

    result = template.render('my_template.txt', var1='value1', var2=16)

To render a template from a string, call the `render_string` function:

    result = template.render_string('Variable var1 is {{ var1 }} and var2 is {{ var2 }}.', var1='value1', var2=16)

#### Rendering HTML

The following example will render an HTML template file from a view:

    from colibris.shortcuts import html_response_template    

    def index(request):
        return html_response_template('index.html', var1='value1')

#### Jinja2 Backend

Make sure to have the `jinja2` python package installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    TEMPLATE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.template.jinja2.Jinja2Backend',
        'extensions': [...],
        'translations': 'gettext'
    }

Field `extensions` is optional and represents a list of extensions to be used by the Jinja2 environment.

Field `translations` is optional and, if present, will enable `gettext`-based Jinja2 translations. Its value is the path
to a python object that implements the `gettext` functions (such as the standard library `gettext`).


## Email Sending

The email sending mechanism is controlled by the `EMAIL` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`. Emails are disabled by
default.

#### Basic Usage

To send an email, just import the `email` package wherever you need it:

    from colibris import email

Then create an email message:

    msg = email.EmailMessage('My Subject', 'my body', to=['email@example.com'])

You can now send it:

    email.send(msg)

Sending is done using the "fire and forget" way; don't expect any result or exceptions from this call. Any errors that
might occur will be logged, though.

Make sure you configure your `default_from` value in your `EMAIL` setting, in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`:

    EMAIL = {
        'default_from': 'myservice@example.com',
        ...
    }

#### Attachments

Attaching a file is as simple as calling the `attach()` method:

    with open('/path/to/myfile.pdf', 'rb') as f:
        msg.attach('myfile.pdf', f.read())

#### HTML Content

Sending HTML content is achieved by specifying the `html` argument to `EmailMessage`:

    msg = email.EmailMessage('My Subject', 'my text body', html='<p>My HTML content</p>', to=['email@example.com'])

The HTML content acts as an alternative to the body and will be used by the mail readers that are capable to show it.

#### Console Backend

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    EMAIL = {
        'backend': 'colibris.email.console.ConsoleBackend'
    }

You'll see the email content printed at standard output.

#### SMTP Backend

Make sure you have the `aiosmtplib` python package installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    EMAIL = {
        'backend': 'colibris.email.smtp.SMTPBackend',
        'host': 'smtp.gmail.com',
        'port': 587,
        'use_tls': True,
        'username': 'user@gmail.com',
        'password': 'yourpassword'
    }


## Background Tasks

Running time-consuming, blocking tasks can be done by using the `taskqueue` functionality in separate workers. The
`TASK_QUEUE` variable in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py` configures the background running task mechanism. Background tasks
are disabled by default.

#### Usage

To run a background task, import the `taskqueue` wherever you need it:

    from colibris import taskqueue
    
Then run your time consuming task:

    def time_consuming_task(arg1, arg2):
        time.sleep(10)
    
    ...
    
    try:
        result = await taskqueue.execute(time_consuming_task, 'value1', arg2='value2', timeout=20)
    
    except Exception as e:
        handle_exception(e)

#### RQ Backend

Make sure to have the `rq` and `redis` python packages installed.

In `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`, set:

    TASK_QUEUE = {
        'backend': 'colibris.taskqueue.rq.RQBackend',
        'host': '127.0.0.1',
        'port': 6379,
        'db': 0,
        'password': 'yourpassword',
        'poll_results_interval': 1
    }

#### Background Worker

To actually execute the queued background tasks, you'll need to spawn at least one worker:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py runworker


## Health Status

You can (and should) implement your project-specific health check function by exposing the `get_health` function in
`app.py`:

    nano ${PACKAGE}/app.py
    
    def get_health():
        if not persist.connectivity_check():
            raise app.HealthException('database connectivity check failed')
    
        return 'healthy'


## Tests

#### The `pytest` Framework

Colibris uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to provide an integrated testing framework. All features, plugins and
common practices available with `pytest` are available with Colibris as well.

#### Writing Tests

One should simply place tests in the `${PACKAGE}/tests` package. The `pytest` discovery mechanism will recursively look
for modules starting with `test_` and will run any function that starts with `test_` or ends with `_test`.

The following functions, placed in a file named e.g. `test_health.py` will test the health status API endpoint:

    async def test_health_check_healthy(web_app_client):
        resp = await web_app_client.get('/health')
        assert resp.status == 200
    
        j = await resp.json()
        assert j == 'healthy'
    
    
    async def test_health_check_db_down(web_app_client):
        persist.get_database().drop()
    
        resp = await web_app_client.get('/health')
        assert resp.status == 500
    
        j = await resp.json()
        assert j['code'] == 'unhealthy'

#### Testing Utilities & Fixtures

`pytest` recommends building tests around *fixtures*. Colibris provides the `web_app_client` fixture which wraps the
`aiohttp_client` fixture and allows simulating HTTP requests "directly", bypassing any network layer.

Other testing utilities can be found in the `utils` module:

    from colibris.test import utils 

For validating enveloped API responses, one can then use `utils.assert_is_envelope`:

    resp = await web_app_client.get('/users')
    assert resp.status == 200
    
    j = await resp.json()
    utils.assert_is_envelope(j, count=2)

#### The `test` Management Command

Running the tests is achieved by running the `test` management command:

    ./${PACKAGE}/manage.py test

Any arguments passed to this command are passed internally to `pytest`. Running `pytest` directly is not recommended and
will probably fail.

#### Test Database

Colibris will use the `TEST_DATABASE` setting for persistence when running tests. In the absence of a field in this
setting (which is by default), corresponding fields from `DATABASE` setting will be used, but `name` will be prefixed
with `test_`.

The test database is created at the setup phase of each test and dropped at the teardown phase. Its structure is created
using migration scripts. Populating it with data is the responsibility of the test writer.

#### The `fixtures` Module

The `./${PACKAGE}/tests/fixtures.py` module can be used to define project-specific testing fixtures as well as
constants. Here's an example of a fixture that creates a test user in the database:

    @pytest.fixture
    def test_user():
        yield models.User.create(username='test_user', password='test_password',
                                 first_name='Test', last_name='User',
                                 email='testuser@example.com')


## Deployment

#### Dependencies and Pipfile

Add your dependencies to `Pipfile`:

    nano Pipfile
    
For example, if you're using PostgreSQL, you may want to add:

    [packages]
    ....
    psycopg2-binary = "*"
    ...

###### Lock Down Versions

Lock your dependencies with their versions in `Pipfile.lock`:

    pipenv lock

###### Install Dependencies

Install all of your project's dependencies:

    pipenv sync
    
#### Using `setuptools`

The project's skeleton comes with a `${PACKAGE}/setup.py` file, effectively allowing your project to be packaged with
`setuptools`.

To create a package of your project, run:

    python setup.py sdist
    
You'll then find your packaged project at `dist/${PROJECT_NAME}-${VERSION}.tar.gz`. The version is automatically read
from `${PACKAGE}/__init__.py`.

The provided setup file will create a console script having your project's main package name, that will basically do
exactly what `manage.py` does.

One thing that is worth noting when using `setuptools` to deploy a project is that the `manage.py` file that used to be
in your project's root folder will now live in the main package of your project.

#### Using Docker

If you want to deploy your service using Docker, you'll first need to edit `Dockerfile` and change it according to your
needs:

    nano Dockerfile

If you plan on using Docker Compose, you'll probably want to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file as well:

    nano docker-compose.yml

###### Building Docker Image

You can manually build the image for your server like this:

    docker build -t ${PROJECT_NAME}:${VERSION} .

If your project has multiple services (e.g. "server" and "worker"), you'll want to build and tag them separately:

    docker build -t ${PROJECT_NAME}:server-${VERSION} --target server .
    docker build -t ${PROJECT_NAME}:worker-${VERSION} --target worker .

###### Manually Run Container

You can run your container locally:

    docker run -it ${PPROJECT_NAME}:${VERSION} -p 8888:8888
    
or, if you have multiple services:

    docker run -it ${PPROJECT_NAME}:server-${VERSION} -p 8888:8888
    docker run -it ${PPROJECT_NAME}:worker-${VERSION}

###### Using `docker-compose`

You can use `docker-compose` to build your images, instead of building them manually:

    docker-compose build 

To start your services, use:

    docker-compose up

When you're done, shut it down by hitting `Ctrl-C`; then you can remove the containers:

    docker-compose down


## Settings

#### The `settings` Module

Each project should have a `${PACKAGE}/settings.py` file, specifying settings that are particular for the project.

#### Settings Schemas

Settings that need to be specified at runtime and depend on the running environment can be supplied via environment
variables.

Settings schemas are used to validate and adapt environment variables before being used as settings. You have to define
your settings schemas that will handle the settings your project wants to collect from the environment.

The following example will use the `DEBUG`, `LISTEN` and `PORT` environment variables to configure the corresponding
settings, when added at the end of your `${PACKAGE}/settings.py`:

    from colibris.conf.schemas import SettingsSchema, fields

    class GeneralSettingsSchema(SettingsSchema):
        DEBUG = fields.Boolean()
        LISTEN = fields.String()
        PORT = fields.Integer()

    GeneralSettingsSchema().load_from_env(globals())

The `globals()` argument ensures overriding values defined in your `${PACKAGE}/settings.py` module. 

Providing values for complex settings, such as `DATABASE` which is defined as a dictionary with parameters, can be done
by specifying the name of the setting as variable prefix:

    class DatabaseSettingsSchema(SettingsSchema):
        NAME = fields.String()
        HOST = fields.String()
        PORT = fields.Integer()
        USERNAME = fields.String()
        PASSWORD = fields.String()
    
        class Meta:
            prefix = 'DATABASE_'

If your project tends to have many such settings schemas, it is recommended that you move them to an e.g.
`${PACKAGE}/settingsshemas.py` module:

    from colibris.conf.schemas import SettingsSchema, fields

    class GeneralSettingsSchema(SettingsSchema):
        DEBUG = fields.Boolean()
        LISTEN = fields.String()
        PORT = fields.Integer()

    class DatabaseSettingsSchema(SettingsSchema):
        NAME = fields.String()
        HOST = fields.String()
        PORT = fields.Integer()
        USERNAME = fields.String()
        PASSWORD = fields.String()
    
        class Meta:
            prefix = 'DATABASE_'

    ...

    def load_from_env(target_settings):
        GeneralSettingsSchema().load_from_env(target_settings)
        DatabaseSettingsSchema().load_from_env(target_settings)

Then import it in `${PACKAGE}/settings.py` and simply call `load_from_env` at the end:

    settingsschemas.load_from_env(globals())

Environment variables can be put together in a `.env` file that is located in the directory where you run your project
from (usually the root folder of your project). This file should never be added to git.

If you want your variables to be part of your project's repository, you can add them to `${PACKAGE}/.env.default`, which
should be added to git.
