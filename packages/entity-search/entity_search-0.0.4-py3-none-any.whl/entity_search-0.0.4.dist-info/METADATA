# Entity Search

This is an entity search framework based on stationary distributions on random walks with diffusion kernel.

## Development
You will need to include the configuration for this repo to your git local configuration.

``
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
``
This step removes the result section in the json document for each execution in the notebooks.


## Testing
In oder to execute the tests, you will need the development dataset. This dataset can be created from the following [repo](https://gitlab.insight-centre.org/ptorres/entity-search-development-data). Once the dataset is created, you need to registered in the configuration file. To simplify this step, just use the incorporated subcommnad `config` where you can defined the development data folder.

For instance, if the dataset is installed in this directory `/data/dev-es`, then you need to execute config as follows:

``
python setup.py config --config-datafolder=/data/dev-es
``

This command will create a configuration file in `etc/` with the proper setup.

Once the configuration file is created, you can execute the tests, as shown below:

``
python setup.py test
``
