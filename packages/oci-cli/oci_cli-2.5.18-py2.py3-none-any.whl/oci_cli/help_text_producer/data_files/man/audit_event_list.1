.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-start\-time [datetime]
.sp
Returns events that were processed at or after this start date and time. For example, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-15T11:30:00Z\fP will retrieve a list of all events processed since 30 minutes after the 11th hour of January 15, 2017, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
You can specify a value with granularity to the minute. If seconds are provided then this will be rounded to the nearest minute, with greater than or equal to 30 seconds rounding up and less than 30 seconds rounding down.
.sp
The following datetime formats are supported:
.SS UTC with milliseconds
.sp
Format: YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssTZD

.SS \-\-end\-time [datetime]
.sp
Returns events that were processed before this end date and time. For example, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\fP and an end value of \fI2017\-01\-02T00:00:00Z\fP will retrieve a list of all events processed on January 1, 2017. Similarly, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\fP and an end value of \fI2017\-02\-01T00:00:00Z\fP will result in a list of all events processed between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2017.
You can specify a value with granularity to the minute. If seconds are provided then this will be rounded to the nearest minute, with greater than or equal to 30 seconds rounding up and less than 30 seconds rounding down.

.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous list query.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results.
.SS \-\-skip\-deserialization
.sp
Skips deserializing service response into python sdk response models and returns as plain JSON object.
.SS \-\-stream\-output
.sp
Print output to stdout as it is fetched so the full response is not stored in memory. This only works with \-\-all.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
