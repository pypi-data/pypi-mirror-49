class AminoAcidMutator
----------------------

.. class:: AminoAcidMutator

   This operator has not been implemented.

   .. method:: AminoAcidMutator.AminoAcidMutator(rate=[], model='general', loci=True, mapIn=[], mapOut=[], output='', begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=True, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=['ind_id'], lineageMode=115)

      Usage:
      
          MatrixMutator(rate, loci=ALL_AVAIL, mapIn=[], mapOut=[],
            output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL,
            subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields="ind_id", lineageMode=FROM_INFO)
      
      Details:
      
          Create a mutator that mutates alleles 0, 1, ..., n-1 using a n by
          n matrix rate. Item (i,j) of this matrix specifies the probability
          at which allele i mutates to allele j. Diagnal items (i, i) are
          ignored because they are automatically determined by other
          probabilities. Only one mutation rate matrix can be specified
          which will be used for all loci in the applied population, or loci
          specified by parameter loci. If alleles other than 0, 1, ..., n-1
          exist in the population, they will not be mutated although a
          warning message will be given if debugging code DBG_WARNING is
          turned on. Please refer to classes mutator and BaseOperator for
          detailed explanation of other parameters.
