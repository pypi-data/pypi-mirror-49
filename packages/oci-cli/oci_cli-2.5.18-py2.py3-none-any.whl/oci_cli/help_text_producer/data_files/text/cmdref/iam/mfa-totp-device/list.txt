list
****


Description
===========

Lists the MFA TOTP devices for the specified user. The returned object
contains the device's OCID, but not the seed. The seed is returned
only upon creation or when the IAM service regenerates the MFA seed
for the device.


Usage
=====

   oci iam mfa-totp-device list [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--user-id [text]
----------------

The OCID of the user. [required]


--page [text]
-------------

The value of the *opc-next-page* response header from the previous
"List" call.


--limit [integer]
-----------------

The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call.


--sort-by [TIMECREATED|NAME]
----------------------------

The field to sort by. You can provide one sort order (*sortOrder*).
Default order for TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for NAME is
ascending. The NAME sort order is case sensitive.

**Note:** In general, some "List" operations (for example,
*ListInstances*) let you optionally filter by Availability Domain if
the scope of the resource type is within a single Availability Domain.
If you call one of these "List" operations without specifying an
Availability Domain, the resources are grouped by Availability Domain,
then sorted.


--sort-order [ASC|DESC]
-----------------------

The sort order to use, either ascending (*ASC*) or descending
(*DESC*). The NAME sort order is case sensitive.


--all
-----

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the --limit option.


--page-size [integer]
---------------------

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
