Pytest plugin providing three logger fixtures with basic or full writing to log files

----


Features
--------

Three logger fixtures, one of each scope: session, module and function.

Three options for writing log records to file: quiet, basic, full.



Requirements
------------

* Pytest
* Pathlib2 (if using Python 2.7)



Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-logfest" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-logfest



Usage
-----

Fixtures
~~~~~~~~
The three logger fixtures exposed by this plugin are:

- ``session_logger``
- ``module_logger``
- ``function_logger``

They expose a Python ``Logger`` object, so you can use them as such, e.g. ``session_logger.INFO("This is a log record of level INFO.")``
The log nodes of these loggers match the path to the corresponding location or file.

Pytest's ``--log-cli-level=<level>`` will display these log records on stdout.


Log filenames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Writing the log records of the loggers to file can be controlled by the ``--logfest`` command-line option:

- ``--logfest=quiet`` or option omitted: no log files are written.
- ``--logfest=basic``: one log file containing INFO and higher for passed tests, DEBUG and higher for setup errors or failed tests.
- ``--logfest=full``: in addition to the basic log file, all log records are written to a session log file and one log file per module.

Log file names and locations are as follows (directories will be created if needed):

- basic log file in ``./artifacts``: ``session-<session timestmap>.log``
- session-level full log file in ``./artifacts``: ``<request.node.name | logfest-root-node>-<session timestmap>.log``
- module-level full log file in ``./artifacts/<path-to-module>``: ``<module_name>-<session timestmap>.log``

``logfest-root-node`` can be set in ``pytest.ini`` (see below). You can change the compostion of file names through hooks (see below).


pytest.ini
~~~~~~~~~~
The following values in ``pytest.ini`` are relevant to this plugin:

- ``logfest-root-node``: name used as root log node and in log filenames; if not set, defaults to the session's ``request.node.name``.
- ``log-level``: should be set to ``info`` or lower, so pytest captures all relevant log records.
- ``log-format``: the default format is not very convenient in combination with this plugin, suggestion: ``%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s``


Hooks
~~~~~
There are three hooks to change the components of the log filenames:

- ``pytest_logfest_log_file_name_basic``
- ``pytest_logfest_log_file_name_full_session``
- ``pytest_logfest_log_file_name_full_module``

The expose a list that will be joined with the separator character ``-`` and appended with ``.log``.
