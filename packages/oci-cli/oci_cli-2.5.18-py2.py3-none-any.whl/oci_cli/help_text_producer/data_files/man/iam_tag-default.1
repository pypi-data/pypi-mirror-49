.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Tag defaults let you specify a default tag (tagnamespace.tag="value") to apply to all resource types in a specified compartment. The tag default is applied at the time the resource is created. Resources that exist in the compartment before you create the tag default are not tagged. The \fITagDefault\fP object specifies the tag and compartment details.
.sp
Tag defaults are inherited by child compartments. This means that if you set a tag default on the root compartment for a tenancy, all resources that are created in the tenancy are tagged. For more information about using tag defaults, see \fI\%Managing Tag Defaults\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingtagdefaults.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment. The tag default will be applied to all new resources created in this compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-tag\-definition\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the tag definition. The tag default will always assign a default value for this tag definition. [required]
.SS \-\-value [text]
.sp
The default value for the tag definition. This will be applied to all new resources created in the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACTIVE]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
