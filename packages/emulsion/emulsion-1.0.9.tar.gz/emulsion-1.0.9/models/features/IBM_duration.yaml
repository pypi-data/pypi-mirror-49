# DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE MACHINES INVOLVED IN THE MODEL
# Each state machine is composed at least of several states.
# The name of a state machine defines an individual variable which
# contains the value of the current state in the individual.
# Transitions define how each change can change to another one.
# Productions define how individuals in one state can produce
# new individuals in another state.
