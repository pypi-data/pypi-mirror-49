## About <a name = "about"></a>
An EmotaPal is a palette of words and colors. 

Just as a 'color palette' describes the colors of some visual object, an 'emotion palette' describes the emotions felt from a visual object. An EmotaPal combines both pieces (visual and psychological) of information. 

## Core Data <a name = "data"></a>
Functionally, this library provides methods to associate emotions with colors through an EmotaPal object. This association is made by predicting the emotion of a color with a K Nearest Neighbors Classifier trained on a dataset with features ```[Emotion, Color]```. That dataset was constructed by (1) sourcing a list of emotion words, (2) downloading top Google Image results for each feeling word, and (3) parsing the dominant color of each Google Image. 

## Use Cases <a name = "usecases"></a>

Maybe you are an artist and are deciding between what color palettes to use. This, in turn, could depend on the psychological associations a color palette provokes. EmotaPal's `from_colors()` constructor will return the emotions associated with colors in your color palettes. 

Maybe you started a brewery and are interested in how regional companies are positioning themselves. EmotaPal's `from_gimg()` constructor will allow you to construct an EmotaPal from google images, so you can "scrape" the probable affective responses to your competitor's logos. 

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
There are 4 ways to construct an EmotaPal. 

### Constructing an EmotaPal

``` Python
from emotapal import EmotaPal

e1 = EmotaPal().from_colors(color_list)
e2 = EmotaPal().from_image(some_image, ncolors)
e3 = EmotaPal().from_url(image_url, ncolors)
e4 = EmotaPal().from_gimg(query, nimages)
```


#### Constructing an EmotaPal from a list of colors. 
``` Python
"""
Params:
  clrs (list): A list of colors, each element either an RGB tupple or hex string 
  topn (int, optional):  Keep only the topn best (input color, emotion color) matches. 
  unique_words (bool, optional): Keep only the best (shortest distance) match if one emotion matches with
   two colors.
"""
ep = EmotaPal(topn=100, unique_words=False).from_colors(clrs)
```

#### Constructing an EmotaPal from an image. 
Note: Do not make ```ncolors``` too high or you'll pick up non-central colors of an image. 

``` Python
""" 
Params:
  img (image): An image object. 
  ncolors (int): Construct a palette from the topn most dominant colors of an image. 
  topn (int, optional): see above
  unique_words (bool, optional): see above
"""
ep = EmotaPal(topn=100, unique_words=False).from_image(img, ncolors)
```

#### Constructing an EmotaPal from a url pointing to an image. 

``` Python
""" 
Params:
  url (str): A url pointing to an image.
  ncolors (int): Construct a palette from the topn colors of an image. 
  topn (int, optional): see above
  unique_words (bool, optional): see above
"""
ep = EmotaPal(topn=100, unique_words=False).from_url(url, ncolors)
```

#### Constructing an EmotaPal from a Google Images query. 

``` Python
""" 
Params:
  query (str): A Google Images query. 
  nimages (int): The number of images to scrape.
  topn (int, optional): see above
  unique_words (bool, optional): see above
"""
ep = EmotaPal(topn=100, unique_words=False).from_gimages(query, nimages)
```

### EmotaPal information and methods
``` Python
ep = EmotaPal().from_url(url)
```
#### Return the info of an EmotaPal. 
An EmotaPal's info is a list of dictionaries, each element containing information on a color, its associated emotion, 
and the distance between the input color and emotion color. This dictionary is sorted by distance (ascending order), 
such that the first entry is the best match and last entry is worst match. 

``` Python
info = ep.info 
```
#### Words

``` Python
words = ep.words.test # return words of EmotaPal
sentiment = ep.words.sentiment # return sentiment of EmotaPal's words
```

#### Colors
``` Python
rgbs = ep.colors.as_rgb # return colors as rgb values
hexs = ep.colors.as_hex # return colors as strings of hex values
ep.colors.display(save_img=False) # display color palette with option to save image
```
