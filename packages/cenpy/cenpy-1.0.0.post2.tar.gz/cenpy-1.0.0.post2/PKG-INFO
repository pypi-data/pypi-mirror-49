        An interface to explore and query the US Census API and return Pandas
        Dataframes. This package is intended for exploratory data
        analysis and draws inspiration from sqlalchemy-like interfaces and
        ``acs.R``. With separate APIs for application developers and folks who 
        only want to get their data quickly & painlessly, ``cenpy`` should meet
        the needs of most who aim to get US Census Data from Python.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Cenpy is easiest to install using ``conda``, a commonly-used package manager for scientific python. First, `install Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`__.
        
        Then, ``cenpy`` is available on the ``conda-forge`` channel:
        ::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge cenpy
        
        Alternatively, you can install cenpy *via* ``pip``, the python package manager, if you have installed ``geopandas`` and ``rtree``:
        :: 
        
            pip install cenpy
        
        
        For Users
        ----------
        Most of the time, users want a simple and direct interface to the US Census Bureau's main products: the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey. Fortunately, cenpy provides a direct interface to these products. For instance, the American Community Survey's most recent 5-year estimates can be accessed using:
        
        ::
        
            import cenpy
            acs = cenpy.products.ACS()
            acs.from_place('Chicago, IL')
        
        Likewise, the decennial census can be accessed using:
        
        ::
        
            import cenpy
            decennial = cenpy.products.Decennial2010()
            decennial.from_place('Seattle, WA')
        
        For more information on how the product API works, consult the `notebook on the topic <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cenpy-devs/cenpy/blob/product/notebooks/product-api.ipynb>`__.
        
        
        For Developers
        ----------------
        The API reference is available at `cenpy-devs.github.io/cenpy <https://cenpy-devs.github.io/cenpy>`__. The ``products`` are typically what most end-users will want to interact with. If you want more fine-grained access to the USCB APIs, you will likely want to build on top of ``APIConnection`` and ``TigerConnection``. 
        
        To create a connection:
        
        ::
        
            cxn = cenpy.remote.APIConnection('DECENNIALSF12010')
        
        Check the variables required and geographies supported:
        
        ::
        
            cxn.variables #is a pandas dataframe containing query-able vbls
            cxn.geographies #is a pandas dataframe containing query-able geographies
        
        Note that some geographies (like tract) have higher-level requirements
        that you'll have to specify for the query to work.
        
        The structure of the query function maps to the Census API's use of
        ``get``, ``for``, and ``in``. The main arguments for the query function
        are ``cols``, ``geo_unit`` and ``geo_filter``, and map back to those predicates, respectively. If more predicates are required for the
        search, they can be added as keyword arguments at the end of the query.
        
        The ``cols`` argument must be a list of columns to retrieve from the
        dataset. Then, you must specify the ``geo_unit`` and ``geo_filter``,
        which provide *what* the unit of aggregation should be and *where* the
        units should be. ``geo_unit`` must be a string containing the unit of
        analysis and an identifier. For instance, if you want all counties in
        Arizona, you specify ``geo_unit = 'county:*'`` and ``geo_filter =
        {'state':'04'}``.
