Customize fonts

In LaTeX, there are nice packages allowing to switch fonts. Hence, for a simple
example we change the mode of the default textengine instance to LaTeX and use
the `preamble` method to load the `times` package. ...

!! In general, it is more easy to use LaTeX with it's NFSS (new font selection
scheme) for font switching, although, in principle, this is also possible in
TeX. The LaTeX Font Catalog at http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ lists common
fonts, which can readily be used in LaTeX. Integrating other fonts into the
LaTeX requires some work. Sometimes one can find ready-to-use adaptions on CTAN
http://ctan.org/.
