class InitLineage
-----------------

.. class:: InitLineage

   This operator assigns lineages at all or part of loci with given
   values. This operator initializes all chromosomes, including unused
   lineage locations and customized chromosomes.


   .. method:: InitLineage(lineage=[], mode=PER_ALLELE, loci=ALL_AVAIL, ploidy=ALL_AVAIL, begin=0, end=1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=["ind_id"])


      This function creates an initializer that initializes lineages
      with either a specified set of values or from the field
      *infoFields* (default to ``ind_id``), whose value will be saved
      as the lineage of modified alleles. If a list of values is
      specified in parameter *lineage*, each value in this list is
      applied to one or more alleles so that each allele
      (``PER_ALLELE``, default mode), alleles on each chromosome
      (``PER_CHROMOSOME``), on chromosomes of each ploidy
      (``PER_PLOIDY``), or for each individual (``PER_INDIVIDUAL``)
      have the same lineage. A single value is allowed and values in
      *lineage* will be re-used if not enough values are provided. If
      an empty list is provided, values 1, 2, 3, .. will be used to
      provide an unique identify for each allele, genotype,
      chromosome, etc. If a valid field is specified (default to
      ``ind_id``), the value of this field will be used for all
      alleles of each individual if *mode* is set to ``FROM_INFO``, or
      be adjusted to produce positive values for alleles on the frist
      ploidy, and negative values for the second ploidy (and so on) if
      *mode* equals to ``FROM_INFO_SIGNED``. If *loci*, *ploidy*
      and/or *subPops* are specified, only specified loci, ploidy, and
      individuals in these (virtual) subpopulations will be
      initialized.
