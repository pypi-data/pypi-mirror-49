    Face recognition model to predict the faces in the images passed to it and return the predicted faces' location,

    Parameters
    -----------
    model_path : string
        The location of the trained model's pickle file.
        Training can be done from train_model module of this package which requires location to store the pickle file.

        Show prediction only if the distance between the nearest point to the predicted embedding of image is less than the threshold_value.
        0.4 is default as it works well in most of the cases and is better for precision.
