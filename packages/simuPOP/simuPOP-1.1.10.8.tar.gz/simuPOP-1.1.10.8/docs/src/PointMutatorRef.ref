class PointMutator
------------------

.. class:: PointMutator

   A point mutator is different from all other mutators because
   mutations in this mutator do not happen randomly. Instead, it
   happens to specific loci and mutate an allele to a specific state,
   regardless of its original state. This mutator is usually used to
   introduce a mutant to a population.


   .. method:: PointMutator(loci, allele, ploidy=0, inds=[], output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=0, infoFields=["ind_id"], lineageMode=FROM_INFO)


      Create a point mutator that mutates alleles at specified *loci*
      to a given *allele* of individuals *inds*. If there are multiple
      alleles at a locus (e.g. individuals in a diploid population),
      only the first allele is mutated unless indexes of alleles are
      listed in parameter *ploidy*. This operator is by default
      applied to individuals in the first subpopulation but you can
      apply it to a different or more than one (virtual)
      subpopulations using parameter *subPops* (``AllAvail`` is also
      accepted). Please refer to class :class:`BaseOperator` for
      detailed descriptions of other parameters.
