        This code identifies the strong lines that dominate the spectrum from
        the large-majority of weaker lines.  The code returns a binary
        line-by-line (LBL) file with the strong lines info (wavenumber, Elow,
        gf, and isotope ID), and an ascii file with the combined contribution
        of the weaker lines compressed into a continuum extinction coefficient
        (in cm-1 amagat-1) as function of wavenumber and temperature.
        
        Currently available databases:

        * HITRAN (https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/)

        ### Install
        ``repack`` has been [tested](https://travis-ci.com/pcubillos/repack) to work on Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7; and runs (at least) in both Linux and OSX.  You can install ``repack`` from the terminal with pip:
        
        ```shell
        # Note that on PyPI ``repack``is indexed as ``lbl-repack``:
        pip install lbl-repack
        ```
        
        Alternative (for conda users or for developers), you can directly
        dowload the source code and install to your local machine with the
        following terminal commands:
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/pcubillos/repack/
        cd repack
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        The following example compresses the Exomol HCN line-transition data.  First, download the ExoMol HCN dataset (there is no need to unzip the files):
        
        ```shell
        # Download ExoMol HCN data:
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.states.bz2
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.trans.bz2
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-12C-14N/Harris/1H-12C-14N__Harris.pf
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.states.bz2
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.trans.bz2
        wget http://exomol.com/db/HCN/1H-13C-14N/Larner/1H-13C-14N__Larner.pf
        ```
        
        Then create a repack configuration file ('*repack_HCN.cfg*') like this below:
        
        ```shell
        [REPACK]
        
        # Line-transition files:
        lblfiles = 1H-12C-14N__Harris.trans.bz2
                   1H-13C-14N__Larner.trans.bz2
        
        # Database type [exomol, hitran, or kurucz]:
        dbtype = exomol
        
        # Output file name (without file extension):
        outfile = HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K
        
        # Wavenumber boundaries and sampling rate (in cm-1):
        wnmin =   303.0
        wnmax = 33334.0
        dwn   =     1.0
        
        # Temperature sampling:
        tmin  =  500.0
        tmax  = 3000.0
        dtemp =  100.0
        
        # Line-intensity threshold for strong/weak lines:
        sthresh = 0.1
        
        # Maximum chunk size of lines to handle at a time:
        chunksize = 15000000
        ```
        
        And run ``repack``, which will produce the following screen output:
        ```shell
        # Call the repack command-line executable for the HCN demo config file:
        repack repack_HCN.cfg

        Successfully rewriten exomol line-transition info into:
          'HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K_lbl.dat' and
          'HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K_continuum.dat'.
        End: Sun Jul  7 19:59:59 2019
        ```
        
        The output binary file '*HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K_lbl.dat*'
        contains the line-by-line opacity information for HCN, which represent
        most of the opacity contribution into the spectrum.  The information
        is encoded as a sequence of three doubles and an integer containing
        the wavenumber (in cm-1), lower-state energy (in cm-1 units),
        gf value, and isotope index, respectively, for each transition.  This
        info can be easily read with the following python script:
        
        ```python
        import repack.utils as u
        wn, elow, gf, iiso = u.read_lbl('HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K_lbl.dat')
        ```
        
        The output ascii file '*HCN_exomol_0.3-33um_500-3000K_continuum.dat*'
        contains the remaining opacity contribution of the weak lines (in cm-1
        amagat-1 units) as function of wavenumber and temperature.  This is a
        minor contribution compared to that of the LBL output file.
