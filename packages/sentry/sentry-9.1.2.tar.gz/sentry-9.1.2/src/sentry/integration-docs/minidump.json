  "html": "<h2 id=\"platform-and-language-support\">Platform and Language Support</h2>\n\n<p>Sentry currently supports minidumps for <strong>Windows, macOS and Linux</strong>. There is no limitation as to which programming language you can use. Sentry can also demangle symbols from the following languages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>C and C++</li>\n  <li>ObjectiveC and ObjectiveC++</li>\n  <li>Swift</li>\n  <li>Rust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Languages not listed above will show the mangled name instead.\n\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"minidump-integration\">Creating and Uploading Minidumps</h2>\n\n<p>Depending on your operating system and programming language, there are various alternatives to create minidumps and upload them to Sentry. See the following resources for libraries that support generating minidump crash reports:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/minidump/breakpad/\">Google Breakpad</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/minidump/crashpad/\">Google Crashpad</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have already integrated a library that generates minidumps and would just like to upload them to Sentry, you need to configure the <em>Minidump Endpoint URL</em>, which can be found at <em>Project Settings &gt; Client Keys (DSN)</em>. This endpoint expects a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">POST</code> request with the minidump in the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">upload_file_minidump</code> field:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>curl <span class=\"nt\">-X</span> POST <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n  <span class=\"s1\">'___MINIDUMP_URL___'</span> <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">-F</span> <span class=\"nv\">upload_file_minidump</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>@mini.dmp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To send additional information, simply add more form fields to this request. For a full description of fields accepted by Sentry, see <a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io#minidump-additional\">Passing Additional Data</a>.\n</p>",
