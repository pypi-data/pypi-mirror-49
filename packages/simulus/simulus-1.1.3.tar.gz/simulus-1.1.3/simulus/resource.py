class Resource(Trappable):
    """A resource provides services to processes.

    A resource basically models a single-server or multi-server queue.
    A resource can allow only a limited number of processes to be
    serviced at any given time. A process arrives and acquires a
    server at the resource. If there is an available server, the
    process will gain access to the resource for as long as the
    service is required. If there isn't an available server, the
    process will be put on hold waiting placed in a queue. When
    another process has finished and released the server, one of the
    waiting processes will be unblocked and gain access to the
    resource.

    A process is expected to following the expected sequence of
    actions to use the resource. The process first calls the acquire()
    method to gain access to a server; this is potentially a blocking
    call: the process may be blocked until a server can be assigned to
    it. Once the call returns, the process has acquired the resource.
    The process can use the resource for as long as it needs to; this
    is usually modeled using the sleep() method. Afterwards, the same
    process is expected to call the release() method to free the
    resource, so that another waiting process may have a chance to
    gain access to the resource.
