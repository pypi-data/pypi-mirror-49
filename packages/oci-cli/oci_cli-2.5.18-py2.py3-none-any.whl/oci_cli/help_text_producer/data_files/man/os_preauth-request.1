.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Pre\-authenticated requests provide a way to let users access a bucket or an object without having their own credentials. When you create a pre\-authenticated request, a unique URL is generated. Users in your organization, partners, or third parties can use this URL to access the targets identified in the pre\-authenticated request. See \fI\%Using Pre\-Authenticated Requests\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-object\-name, \-on [text]
.sp
The name of the object that is being granted access to by the pre\-authenticated request. Avoid entering confidential information. The object name can be null and if so, the pre\-authenticated request grants access to the entire bucket.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
