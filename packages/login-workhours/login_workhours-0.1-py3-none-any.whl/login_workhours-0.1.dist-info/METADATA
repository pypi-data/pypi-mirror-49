# Compute working hours from logins and logouts

I never know how much time I'm spending at work per week, so I wrote a little script that gets me this information out of logins / logouts.

It obviously only work if you have a separated computer for work and for your personal use. But that's my case!

Installation
============

It's pretty simple to install, here are a few lines for you::

    $ pip install login-workhours
