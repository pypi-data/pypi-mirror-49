Function simulateBackwardTrajectory
-----------------------------------


.. function:: simulateBackwardTrajectory(N, endGen, endFreq, nLoci=1, fitness=None, minMutAge=None, maxMutAge=None, maxAttempts=1000, logger=None)

   Given a demographic model (*N*) and the fitness of genotype at one or
   more loci (*fitness*), this function simulates a trajectory of one or more
   unlinked loci (*nLoci*) from allele frequency *freq* at generation *endGen*
   backward in time, until all alleles get lost. A ``Trajectory`` object will
   be returned if the length of simulated Trajectory with ``minMutAge`` and
   ``maxMutAge`` (if specified). ``None`` will be returned if no valid
   Trajectory is simulated after ``maxAttempts`` attempts. Please refer to
   class ``Trajectory``, ``TrajectorySimulator`` and their member functions
   for more details about allowed input for these parameters. If a *logger*
   object is given, it will send detailed debug information at ``DEBUG``
   level and ending generation and frequency at the ``INFO`` level. The latter
   can be used to adjust your fitness model and/or ending allele frequency
   if a trajectory is difficult to obtain because of parameter mismatch.
