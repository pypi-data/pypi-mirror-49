Description: DyNet
        =====
        
        The Dynamic Neural Network Toolkit
        
        DyNet (formerly known as `cnn <http://github.com/clab/cnn-v1>`__) is a
        neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many
        others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python) and is designed
        to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU, and to work well with
        networks that have dynamic structures that change for every training
        instance. For example, these kinds of networks are particularly
        important in natural language processing tasks, and DyNet has been used
        to build state-of-the-art systems for `syntactic
        parsing <https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser>`__, `machine
        translation <https://github.com/neubig/lamtram>`__, `morphological
        inflection <https://github.com/mfaruqui/morph-trans>`__, and many other
        application areas.
