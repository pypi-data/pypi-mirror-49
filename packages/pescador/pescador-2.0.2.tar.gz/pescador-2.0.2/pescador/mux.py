'''\
Defines the interface and several varieties of *mux*. A *mux* is
a `Streamer` which wraps N other `Streamer` objects, and at every step yields a
sample from one of its sub-streamers.

This module defines the following Mux types:

`StochasticMux`
    A Mux which chooses its active streams stochastically, and chooses
    samples from the active streams stochastically. `StochasticMux` is equivalent
    to the `pescador.Mux` from versions <2.0.

     `StochasticMux` has a `mode` parameter which selects how it operates, with
     the following modes:

    `with_replacement`

        Sample streamers with replacement.  This allows a single stream to
        be used multiple times simultaneously.

    `exhaustive`

        Each streamer is consumed at most once and never
        re-activated.

    `single_active`

        Each stream in the candidate pool is either active or not.
        Streams are revived when they are exhausted.
        This setting makes it so that streams in the
        active pool are *uniquely* selected from the candidate pool, where as
        `with_replacement` allows the same stream to be used more than once.

`ShuffledMux`
    A `ShuffledMux` interleaves samples from all given streamers.


`RoundRobinMux`
    Iterates over all the streamers in strict order.

`ChainMux`
    As in itertools.chain(), runs the first streamer to exhaustion, then
    the second, then the third, etc. Uses only a single stream at a time.

`Mux`
    The pescador<2.0 `Mux` is still available and works the same,
    but is deprecated.

    We recommend replacing all uses of `Mux` with `StochasticMux`.

        3. Yield samples from the streams by randomly multiplexing
           from the active set.
        4. When a stream is exhausted, select a new one from `streamers`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        streamers : iterable of streamers
            The collection of streamer-type objects

        k : int > 0
            The number of streams to keep active at any time.

        rate : float > 0 or None
            Rate parameter for the poisson distribution governing sample counts
            for individual streams.
            If ``None``, each active stream is sampled until exhaustion.

        weights : np.ndarray or None
            Optional weighting for ``streamers``.
            If ``None``, then weights are assumed to be uniform.
            Otherwise, ``weights[i]`` defines the sampling proportion
            of ``streamers[i]``.

            Must have the same length as ``streamers``.

        with_replacement : bool
            Sample streamers with replacement.  This allows a single stream to
            be used multiple times (even simultaneously).
            If ``False``, then each streamer is consumed at most once and never
            revisited.

        prune_empty_streams : bool
            Disable streamers that produce no data.
            If ``True``, streamers that previously produced no data are never
            revisited.
            Note:
            1. This may be undesirable for streams where past emptiness
            may not imply future emptiness.
            2. Failure to prune truly empty streams with `revive=True` can
            result in infinite looping behavior. Disable with caution.

        revive: bool
            If ``with_replacement`` is ``False``, setting ``revive=True``
            will re-insert previously exhausted streams into the candidate set.

            This configuration allows a stream to be active at most once at any
            time.

        random_state : None, int, or np.random.RandomState
            If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
            generator;

            If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number

                Streams are sampled independently and indefinitely.

                This configuration allows a stream to be active at most once
