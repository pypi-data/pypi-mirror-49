Description: 
        # Udacity Project Assistant
        
        udacity_pa is the command-line tool for submitting code to Udacity's automatic feedback agent.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To submit your code, first navigate to the top-level directory of the repository you cloned from github.  From here, run
        ```
            udacity submit <PROJECT_NAME>
        ```
        This will create a zipfile containing the required files and submit it to an automated feedback agent.  When you are  satisfied with the result, you may submit this zipfile for a human review.
        
        In case you accidentally removed the zipfile, you may list all of your submissions with the command
        
        ```
            udacity ls <PROJECT_NAME>
        ```
        
        To re-download the zipfile and the feedback, use
        
        ```
            udacity get <SUBMISSION_ID>
        ```
