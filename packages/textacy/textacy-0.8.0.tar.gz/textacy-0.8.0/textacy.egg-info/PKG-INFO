Description: ## textacy: NLP, before and after spaCy
        
        textacy is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language
        processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the
        fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. ---
        delegated to another library, textacy focuses primarily on the tasks
        that come before and follow after.
