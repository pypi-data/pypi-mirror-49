Description: # Crawler Framework
        #### About
        Main objective is to secure fast deployment of crawler system that will help you setup all that you need to 
        get started with data mining interactively over cmd/terminal.
        Concept is based on long working experience and mistakes that have been learned over the years in data mining 
        and database arhitecture. It could save you a lot of time and effort using this framework.
        
        ### Installation
        Most important you should have python 3 installed on your machine. 
        
        In my case I use ```pip3.7 install crawler_framework```. 
        
        But it should work also with python 3.6 and
        for older versions I didn't tested so please be sure to send me msg if it works on other python 3 versions.
        
        ### Setup
        ####Database configuration
        Before we can deploy anything we must setup connection strings for oneor more database 
        servers that we are going to use.
        Currently supported are PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.
        
        **Step 1**
        
        Open cmd/terminal and write dbconfig.py. If you have installed python 2.7 and it is set as your primary interpreter 
        you will have to follow instructions in program and then you will be able to work with framework. 
        Don't worry it will not change anything for your older programs, it will only give directions to 
        crawler framework so he could easly operate in future. It is necessary to do it only ones on single machine 
        if python 2.7 is installed as primary interpreter. If everything goes well you should see this options below.
