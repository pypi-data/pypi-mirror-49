.. class:: BaseQuanTrait

   A quantitative trait in  simuPOP is simply an information field. A
   quantitative trait model simply assigns values to one or more
   information fields (called trait fields) of each individual
   according to its genetic (genotype) and environmental (information
   field) factors. It can be applied at any stage of an evolutionary
   cycle. If a quantitative trait operator is applied before or after
   mating, it will set the trait fields of all parents and offspring.
   If it is applied during mating, it will set the trait fields of
   each offspring.

   When a quantitative trait operator is applied to a population, it
   is only applied to the current generation. You can, however, use
   parameter *ancGen=-1* to set the trait field of all ancestral
   generations, or a generation index to apply to only ancestral
   generation younger than *ancGen*. Note that this parameter is
   ignored if the operator is applied during mating.


   .. method:: BaseQuanTrait(ancGens=UNSPECIFIED, begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a base quantitative trait operator. This operator assigns
      one or more quantitative traits to trait fields in the present
      generation (default). If ``ALL_AVAIL`` or a list of ancestral
      generations are specified, this operator will be applied to
      individuals in these generations as well. A quantitative trait
      operator can be applied to specified (virtual) subpopulations
      (parameter *subPops*) and replicates (parameter *reps*).


   .. method:: BaseQuanTrait.apply(pop)

      set ``qtrait`` to all individual
