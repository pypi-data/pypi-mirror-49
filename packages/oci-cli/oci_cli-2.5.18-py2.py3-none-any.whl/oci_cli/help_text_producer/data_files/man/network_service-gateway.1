.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific Oracle services such as Object Storage without exposing the VCN to the public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined for a supported Oracle service (see \fI\%ListServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Service/ListServices\fP>) is routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway for this traffic. For more information, see \fI\%Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Adds the specified \fI\%Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Service/\fP> to the list of enabled \fIService\fP objects for the specified gateway. You must also set up a route rule with the \fIcidrBlock\fP of the \fIService\fP as the rule\(aqs destination and the service gateway as the rule\(aqs target. See \fI\%Route Table\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/RouteTable/\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The \fIAttachServiceId\fP operation is an easy way to add an individual \fIService\fP to the service gateway. Compare it with \fI\%UpdateServiceGateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/ServiceGateway/UpdateServiceGateway\fP>, which replaces the entire existing list of enabled \fIService\fP objects with the list that you provide in the \fIUpdate\fP call.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state.

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp

.SS \-\-services [complex type]
.sp
List of all the \fIService\fP objects you want enabled on this service gateway. Sending an empty list means you want to disable all services. Omitting this parameter entirely keeps the existing list of services intact.
.sp
You can also enable or disable a particular \fIService\fP by using \fI\%AttachServiceId\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/ServiceGateway/AttachServiceId\fP> or \fI\%DetachServiceId\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/ServiceGateway/DetachServiceId\fP>\&.
.sp
For each enabled \fIService\fP, make sure there\(aqs a route rule with the \fIService\fP object\(aqs \fIcidrBlock\fP as the rule\(aqs destination and the service gateway as the rule\(aqs target. See \fI\%Route Table\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/RouteTable/\fP>\&.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type ServiceIdRequestDetails.  For documentation on ServiceIdRequestDetails please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/ServiceIdRequestDetails\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp

in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
