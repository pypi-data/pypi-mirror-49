# build a complex model of different components

def particlesWithInteraction(q, Ra, Rb, molarity, bgr, contrast, collimation=None, beta=True):
    """
    Particles with interaction and ellipsoid form factor as a model for e.g. dense protein solutions.

    Document your model if needed for later use that you know what you did and why.
    Or make it short without all the nasty documentation for testing.
    The example neglects the protein exact shape and non constant scattering length density.
    Proteins are more potato shaped  and nearly never like a ellipsoid or sphere.
    So this model is only valid at low Q as an approximation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float
        Wavevector
    Ra,Rb : float
        Radius
    molarity : float
        Concentration in mol/l
    contrast : float
        Contrast between ellipsoid and solvent.
    bgr : float
        Background e.g. incoherent scattering
    collimation : float
        Collimation length for SANS. For SAXS use None.
    beta : bool
        True include asymmetry factor beta of
        M. Kotlarchyk and S.-H. Chen, J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2461 (1983).

    Returns
    -------
        dataArray

    Notes
    -----
    Explicitly:
    **The return value can be a dataArray OR only Y values**. Both is working for fitting.
