.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
By default, buckets created using the Amazon S3 Compatibility API or the Swift API are created in the root compartment of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.
.sp
You can change the default Swift/Amazon S3 compartmentId designation to a different compartmentId. All subsequent bucket creations will use the new default compartment, but no previously created buckets will be modified. A user must have NAMESPACE_UPDATE permission to make changes to the default compartments for Amazon S3 and Swift.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-default\-s3\-compartment\-id [text]
.sp
The updated compartment id for use by an S3 client, if this field is set.
.SS \-\-default\-swift\-compartment\-id [text]
.sp
The updated compartment id for use by a Swift client, if this field is set.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
