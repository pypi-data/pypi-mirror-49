.SS Options
.SS \-\-ip\-address [text]
.sp
The IP address of the backend server.
.sp
Example: \fI10.0.0.3\fP [required]
.SS \-\-port [integer]
.sp
The communication port for the backend server.
.sp
Example: \fI8080\fP [required]
.SS \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the load balancer associated with the backend set and servers. [required]
.SS \-\-backend\-set\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the backend set to add the backend server to.
.sp
Example: \fIexample_backend_set\fP [required]
.SS \-\-weight [integer]
.sp
The load balancing policy weight assigned to the server. Backend servers with a higher weight receive a larger proportion of incoming traffic. For example, a server weighted \(aq3\(aq receives 3 times the number of new connections as a server weighted \(aq1\(aq. For more information on load balancing policies, see \fI\%How Load Balancing Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Reference/lbpolicies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI3\fP
.SS \-\-backup [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should treat this server as a backup unit. If \fItrue\fP, the load balancer forwards no ingress traffic to this backend server unless all other backend servers not marked as "backup" fail the health check policy.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-drain [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should drain this server. Servers marked "drain" receive no new incoming traffic.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-offline [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should treat this server as offline. Offline servers receive no incoming traffic.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
