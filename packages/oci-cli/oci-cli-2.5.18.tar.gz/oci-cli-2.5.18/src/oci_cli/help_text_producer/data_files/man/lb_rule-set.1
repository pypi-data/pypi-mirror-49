.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A named set of rules associated with a load balancer. Rules are objects that represent actions to apply to a listener, such as adding, altering, or removing HTTP headers. For more information, see \fI\%Managing Rule Sets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Tasks/managingrulesets.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new rule set associated with the specified load balancer. For more information, see \fI\%Managing Rule Sets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Tasks/managingrulesets.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the specified load balancer. [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name for this set of rules. It must be unique and it cannot be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIexample_rule_set\fP [required]
.SS \-\-items [complex type]
.sp
An array of rules that compose the rule set.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
