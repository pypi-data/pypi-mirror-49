.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
Filters results by compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous "List" call.
.SS \-\-sort\-by [id|displayName]
.sp
The field to sort by when listing monitors.
.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
Controls the sort order of results.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
Filters results that exactly match the \fIdisplayName\fP field.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
