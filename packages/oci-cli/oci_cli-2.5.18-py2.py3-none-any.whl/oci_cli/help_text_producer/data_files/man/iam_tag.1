.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A tag definition that belongs to a specific tag namespace.  "Defined tags" must be set up in your tenancy before you can apply them to resources. For more information, see \fI\%Managing Tags and Tag Namespaces\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new tag in the specified tag namespace.
.sp
You must specify either the OCID or the name of the tag namespace that will contain this tag definition.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the tag, which must be unique across all tags in the tag namespace and cannot be changed. The name can contain any ASCII character except the space (_) or period (.) characters. Names are case insensitive. That means, for example, "myTag" and "mytag" are not allowed in the same namespace. If you specify a name that\(aqs already in use in the tag namespace, a 409 error is returned.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the tag. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it with \fI\%UpdateTag\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Tag/UpdateTag\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-tag\-namespace\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the tag namespace. [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name you assign to the tag during creation. The name must be unique within the tag namespace and cannot be changed. [required]
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the tag during creation. [required]
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-is\-cost\-tracking [boolean]
.sp
Indicates whether the tag is enabled for cost tracking.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACTIVE|INACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
