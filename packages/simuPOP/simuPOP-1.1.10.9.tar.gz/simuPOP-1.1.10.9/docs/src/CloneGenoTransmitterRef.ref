class CloneGenoTransmitter
--------------------------

.. class:: CloneGenoTransmitter

   This during mating operator copies parental genotype directly to
   offspring. This operator works for all mating schemes when one or
   two parents are involved. If both parents are passed, maternal
   genotype are copied. In addition to genotypes on all non-customized
   or specified chromosomes, sex and information fields are by default
   also coped copied from parent to offspring.


   .. method:: CloneGenoTransmitter(output="", chroms=ALL_AVAIL, begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=ALL_AVAIL)


      Create a clone genotype transmitter (a during-mating operator)
      that copies genotypes from parents to offspring. If two parents
      are specified, genotypes are copied maternally. After genotype
      transmission, offspring sex and affection status is copied from
      the parent even if sex has been determined by an offspring
      generator. All or specified information fields (parameter
      *infoFields*, default to ``ALL_AVAIL``) will also be copied from
      parent to offspring. Parameters *subPops* is ignored. This
      operator by default copies genotypes on all autosome and sex
      chromosomes (excluding customized chromosomes), unless a
      parameter *chroms* is used to specify which chromosomes to copy.
      This operator also copies allelic lineage when it is executed in
      a module with lineage allele type.
