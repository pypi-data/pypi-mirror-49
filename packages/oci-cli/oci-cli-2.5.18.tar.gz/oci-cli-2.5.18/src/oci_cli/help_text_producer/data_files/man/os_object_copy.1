Creates a request to copy an object within a region or to another region.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-bucket\-name, \-bn [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: \fImy\-new\-bucket1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-source\-object\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the object to be copied. [required]
.SS \-\-destination\-bucket [text]
.sp
The destination bucket the object will be copied to. [required]
.SS \-\-source\-object\-if\-match\-e\-tag [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to match against that of the source object. Used to confirm that the source object with a given name is the version of that object storing a specified ETag.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-if\-match\-e\-tag [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to match against that of the destination object (an object intended to be overwritten). Used to confirm that the destination object stored under a given name is the version of that object storing a specified entity tag.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-if\-none\-match\-e\-tag [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to avoid matching. The only valid value is \(aq*\(aq, which indicates that the request should fail if the object already exists in the destination bucket.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Arbitrary string keys and values for the user\-defined metadata for the object. Keys must be in "opc\-meta\-
.nf
*
.fi
" format. Avoid entering confidential information. Metadata key\-value pairs entered in this field are assigned to the destination object. If you enter no metadata values, the destination object will inherit any existing metadata values associated with the source object.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|COMPLETED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-destination\-region [text]
.sp
The destination region object will be copied to.
.SS \-\-destination\-namespace [text]
.sp
The destination namespace object will be copied to.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-name [text]
.sp
The destination name for the copy object.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
