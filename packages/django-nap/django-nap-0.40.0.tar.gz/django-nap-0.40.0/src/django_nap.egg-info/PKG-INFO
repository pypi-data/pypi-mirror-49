        Change log: https://django-nap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html
        
        An API library for Django
        
        A minimalist approach to object de/serialisers, RESTful views, and RPC views.
        
        Benefits
        --------
        
        1. Modular
        
            Unlike some tools, the Serialiser definition is separate from the API.
        
            This not only makes it easier to have different 'shapes' of data for
            different endpoints, but also allows using them in more places, not just
            your API.
        
        1. Simple
        
            If you want an API that provides every feature ever, go look at Django REST
            Framework.  But if you want something simple and fast, this is your tool.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        It is NOT necessary to add nap to your INSTALLED\_APPS.  It does not provide
        models, templates, template tags, or static files.
        
        Tests are currently run for Python 3.4-3.7 and pypy3, and against Django
        versions 2.0 and up.
