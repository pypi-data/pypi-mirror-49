    A multiprocessing manager effectively creates a separate process
    that keeps the master job context object.  Other threads access
    job context via multiprocessing proxy objects.

    While this would naturally lend itself @property's it seems to make
    a little more sense to use functions to make it explicitly that the
    invocation requires marshalling data across a process boundary.
