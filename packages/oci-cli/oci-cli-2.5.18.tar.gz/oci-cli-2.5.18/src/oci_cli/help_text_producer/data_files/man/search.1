.SS Options
.SS \-\-text [text]
.sp
The text to search for. [required]
.SS \-\-matching\-context\-type [NONE|HIGHLIGHTS]
.sp
The type of matching context returned in the response. If you specify \fIHIGHLIGHTS\fP, then the service will highlight fragments in its response. (See ResourceSummary.searchContext and SearchContext for more information.) The default setting is \fINONE\fP\&.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of items to return. The value must be between 1 and 1000.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The page at which to start retrieving results.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
