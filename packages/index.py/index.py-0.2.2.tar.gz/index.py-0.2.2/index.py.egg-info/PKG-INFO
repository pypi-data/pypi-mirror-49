        # index.py
        
        Although I've never used PHP, I like its hot-swap mechanism. I expect to use index.py to make Python's Web program deployment easier.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install -U index.py
        ```
        
        Or get the latest version on Github
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/abersheeran/index.py
        sudo python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        Make a folder that name is `views` and create `index.py` in it.
        
        Write the following in `index.py`
        
        ```python
        from index.view import View
        
        
        class HTTP(View):
        
            def get(self):
                return "hello world"
        ```
        
        Execute the command `index-cli dev` in the same directory as `views`.
        
        ### deploy
        
        In linux, you can use `index-cli gunicorn start` to start server.
        
        * `-w INT`: The number of worker processes for handling requests. This value is best when it is equal to the number of cores of the CPU.
        
        * `-d`: Increasing this parameter will cause the program to run in the background and redirect the log to the `log.index` in the current directory.
        
        In windows......maybe you can use `index-cli dev` to deploy.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        The configuration allows the configuration to be automatically separated by ENV, and lowercase letters in all keys are automatically converted to uppercase.
        
        You can use `Config()` anywhere in the program to use the configuration, which is a class that uses the singleton pattern. Like this
        
        ```
        from index import Config
        
        print(Config())
        ```
        
        ### Environment variables
        
        At startup, index automatically reads the configuration from the environment variable that begins with `INDEX_`.
        
        like this
        
        ```
        INDEX_DEBUG=on
        INDEX_ENV=pro
        ```
        
        ### Config file
        
        At the root of your web program, the configuration in `config.json` will be read when index starts.
        
        example:
        
        ```json
        {
          "dev": {
            "debug": true,
          },
          "pro": {
            "debug": false,
            "port": 34567,
            "host": "0.0.0.0"
          }
        }
        ```
        
        ### List
        
        * ENV
        
          **Default: `"dev"`**
        
          `env` is an important configuration that allows for the distinction between different configuration environments.
        
        * DEBUG
        
          **Default: `False`**
        
          I don't think this needs explanation.
        
          In the environment variable, INDEX_DEBUG is true when it is on or True, otherwise it is false.
        
        * LOG_LEVEL
        
          **Default: `"info"`**
        
          `log_level` has five values, the corresponding table to the `logging` is as follows
        
          log_level   |loggins
          ---         |---
          "critical"  | logging.CRITICAL
          "error"     | logging.ERROR
          "warning"   | logging.WARNING
          "info"      | logging.INFO
          "debug"     | logging.DEBUG
        
        * HOST
        
          **Default: `"127.0.0.1"`**
        
          `host` specifies the bound HOST address.
        
        * PORT
        
          **Default: `4190`**
        
          `port` pecifies the bound HOST port.
        
        * ALLOWED_HOSTS
        
          **Default: `["*"]`**
        
          `allowed_hosts` allows you to restrict access to this application's host.
        
          Some examples:
        
            - ["*"]
        
            - ["example.com", "*example.com"]
        
            - ["example.com", "test.com"]
        
        * ALLOW_UNDERLINE
        
          **Default: `False`**
        
          `allow_underline` allows you to determine if an underscore is allowed in the URI by configuring a boolean value. When it is false, if _ exists in the uri, it will be replaced with - and redirected.
