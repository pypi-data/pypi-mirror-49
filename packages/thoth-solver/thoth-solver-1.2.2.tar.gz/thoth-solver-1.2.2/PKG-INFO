Description: Thoth Solver
        ------------
        
        Dependency solver used in `Thoth project <https://thoth-station.ninja>`_.
        
        Project Scope
        =============
        
        The aim of this project is to answer a simple question - what packages will be
        installed (resolved by pip) for the provided stack?
        
        Imagine you have an application that has one dependency:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          $ cat requirements.txt
          tensorflow
        
        
        This project will tell you how dependencies could be resolved:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          thoth-solver -vvv pypi -r requirements.txt 
        
        The output can be found at `here <https://github.com/thoth-station/misc/blob/master/examples/runtime-environment/resolved.json>`_.
        
        You can optionally also specify a list of indexes which should be checked for each package.
        
        Installation and Deployment
        ===========================
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          git clone git@github.com:thoth-station/solver.git thoth-solver
          cd thoth-solver
          PYTHONPATH='.' ./thoth-solver-cli --help
        
        
        This project is also released on
        `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/thoth-solver>`_, so the latest release can be
        installed via pip or `Pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
          pipenv install thoth-solver
        
        
        Solver is run in Thoth to gather information about package dependencies. You
        can find deployment templates in the `openshift/` directory present in the
        root of `solver's Git repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/solver>`_. The
        actual deployment is done using Ansible playbooks available in the
        `Thoth's core repository <https://github.com/thoth-station/core>`_.
