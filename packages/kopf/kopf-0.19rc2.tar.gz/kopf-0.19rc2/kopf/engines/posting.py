"""
All the functions to write the Kubernetes events for the Kubernetes objects.

They are used internally in the handling routines to show the progress,
and can be used directly from the handlers to add arbitrary custom events.

The actual k8s-event posting runs in the background,
and posts the k8s-events as soon as they are queued.

The k8s-events are queued in two ways:

* Explicit calls to `kopf.event`, `kopf.info`, `kopf.warn`, `kopf.exception`.
* Logging messages made on the object logger (above INFO level by default).

This also includes all logging messages posted by the framework itself.
