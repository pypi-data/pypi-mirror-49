LoRaWAN/The Things Network, for CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading `the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora

Usage Example
=============

Usage is described in the `learn guide for this library <https://learn.adafruit.com/using-lorawan-and-the-things-network-with-circuitpython>`_.

Building locally
================

Zip release files
-----------------

To build this library locally you'll need to install the
`circuitpython-build-tools <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-build-tools>`_ package.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install circuitpython-build-tools

Once installed, make sure you are in the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    source .env/bin/activate

Then run the build:

.. code-block:: shell

    circuitpython-build-bundles --filename_prefix adafruit-circuitpython-tinylora --library_location .

Sphinx documentation
-----------------------

Sphinx is used to build the documentation based on rST files and comments in the code. First,
install dependencies (feel free to reuse the virtual environment from above):

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme

Now, once you have the virtual environment activated:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd docs
    sphinx-build -E -W -b html . _build/html

This will output the documentation to ``docs/_build/html``. Open the index.html in your browser to
view them. It will also (due to -W) error out on any warning like Travis will. This is a good way to
locally verify it will pass.

This library was written by ClemensRiederer. We've converted it to work with Adafruit CircuitPython and made
changes so it works with the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit Feather M0/M4. We've added examples for using this library
to transmit data and sensor data to The Things Network.
