> A minimal mocking utility for C projects.

**ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§**

Narmock identifies the mocks being used in your tests and generates easy-to-use implementations with a slick API.

```c
#include <time.h>

#include "__mocks__.h"
#include "narwhal.h"

TEST(example)
{
    MOCK(time)->mock_return(42);
    ASSERT_EQ(time(NULL), 42);
}
```

> Most of the examples in this README are tests written with [Narwhal](https://github.com/vberlier/narwhal) but Narmock can be used with other test frameworks and anywhere in regular source code.

## Installation

The package can be installed with `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install narmock
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues and suggest improvements. This project uses [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) so you'll need to install it first if you want to be able to work with the project locally.

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

You should now be able to install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ poetry install
```

The code follows the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) code style.

```bash
$ poetry run black narmock
```

You can run the tests with `poetry run make -C tests`. The test suite is built with [Narwhal](https://github.com/vberlier/narwhal).

```bash
$ poetry run make -C tests
```
