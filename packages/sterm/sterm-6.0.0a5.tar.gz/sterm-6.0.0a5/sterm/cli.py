def ReceiveData(uart, term):
    """
    This function reads every 0.1 seconds all data from the serial input buffer.
    The read data then gets printed to the screen (stdout).
    After writing to the output buffer, the buffer gets flushed so that the data is visible to the user
    as soon as possible.
    The function is blocking and runs until the global variable ``ShutdownReveiver`` get set to ``False``
    or when reading from the input buffer raises an exception.

    The behavior of this function depends on the ``binary`` argument:

    In *binary mode* the received bytes get encoded as one byte hexadecimal numbers with ``0x`` prefix,
    space separated and a space at the end of the byte stream.
    So when receiving the two bytes ``23``, ``42`` the output is ``0x23 0x42 ``.

    In *UTF-8 mode* the received data gets interpreted as UTF-8 encoded Unicode string.
    When an UnicodeDecodeError-Exception occurs, the raw data gets printed between ``[]``.

    Is the ``logfile`` parameter a sting, then all received data gets written into that file.
    In *binary mode* the data gets stored binary, otherwise it gets stored UTF-8 encoded.
    Also ANSI-Escape-Sequences will be stored in the file.
    The file gets opened in *append mode*. Old data will not be overwritten.

    This function is intended to run in a separate thread.
    The following example shows how to handle this function.

        # Start receiver thread
        ReceiverThread = Thread(target=ReceiveData, args=(uart, ))

    This function handles the user input in *Unbuffered Mode*.
    It reads the input from *stdin* byte by byte and sends it directly UTF-8 encoded to the UART device.

    the data to the UART device.
