Screaming is an authentic scream string package. It will provide a randomized screaming string.

Here is an example script:

```python
import screaming

scream_string = screaming.scream().getScream()
```
This package has not yet added options for different types of screams (cat, dog, ghost etc) but does plan to add that in the future.
