.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified availability domain. For general information about instances, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the \fIsourceDetails\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet\(aqs CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic\fP> with the VNIC ID.
.sp
You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
The availability domain of the instance.
.sp
Example: \fIUocm:PHX\-AD\-1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]
.sp
The shape of an instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and other resources allocated to the instance.
.sp
You can enumerate all available shapes by calling \fI\%ListShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes\fP>\&. [required]
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIMy bare metal instance\fP
.SS \-\-extended\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the \(aqmetadata\(aq object.
.sp
They are distinguished from \(aqmetadata\(aq fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas \(aqmetadata\(aq fields are string/string maps only).
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-fault\-domain [text]
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you. To change the fault domain for an instance, terminate it and launch a new instance in the preferred fault domain.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
Example: \fIFAULT\-DOMAIN\-1\fP
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-hostname\-label [text]
.sp
The hostname for the VNIC that is created during instance launch. Used for DNS. The value is the hostname portion of the instance\(aqs fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., \fIbminstance\-1\fP in FQDN \fIbminstance\-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com\fP). Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with \fI\%RFC 952\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952\fP> and \fI\%RFC 1123\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123\fP>\&. The value cannot be changed, and it can be retrieved from the \fI\%Vnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/\fP>\&.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fIbminstance\-1\fP
.SS \-\-image\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the image used to boot the instance. This is a shortcut for specifying an image source via the \-\-source\-details complex JSON parameter. If this parameter is provided, you cannot provide the \-\-source\-details or \-\-source\-boot\-volume\-id parameters.
.SS \-\-ipxe\-script\-file [filename]
.sp
This is an advanced option.
.sp
When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.
.sp
If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.
.sp
The default iPXE script connects to the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
.sp
