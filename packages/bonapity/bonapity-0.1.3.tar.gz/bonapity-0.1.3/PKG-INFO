                # 👀 BONAPITY 👀
        
                `bonAPIty` is a python3 package allowing you to create simple API (GET) 
                for your functions without writting any complicated line of server code
                and it's even simpler than Flask !
        
                You are the 👨‍🍳, just do what you do the best : cook code !
                don't loose your time to 💁, we do it for you... :)
        
                By type hinting your code we cast 
                the received inputs to the right type ! 
                so don't worry about it... 😀
