"""Classes for JSON serialization of SQLAlchemy models.

The abstract base class :class:`Serializer` can be used to implement
custom serialization from SQLAlchemy objects. The
:class:`DefaultSerializer` provide some basic serialization as expected
by classes that follow the JSON API protocol.

The implementations here are closely coupled to the rest of the
Flask-Restless code.
