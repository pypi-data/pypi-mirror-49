.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The Database Service supports several types of DB systems, ranging in size, price, and performance. For details about each type of system, see:
\- Exadata DB Systems \- Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
For information about access control and compartments, see Overview of the Identity Service.
For information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability Domains].
To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity Service API.
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

Fault Domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the Fault Domain, the system selects one for you. To change the Fault Domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred Fault Domain.
.sp
If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which Fault Domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the Fault Domains you specify so that no Fault Domain contains more than one node.
.sp
To get a list of Fault Domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
