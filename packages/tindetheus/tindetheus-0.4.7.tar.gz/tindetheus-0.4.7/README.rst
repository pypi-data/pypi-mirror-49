tindetheus
==========

Build personalized machine learning models for Tinder based on your
historical preference using Python.

There are three parts to this: 1. A function to build a database which
records everything about the profiles you’ve liked and disliked. 2. A
function to train a model to your database. 3. A function to use the
trained model to automatically like and dislike new profiles.

How it works
============

The last layer of a CNN trained for facial classification can be used as
a feature set which describes an individual’s face. It just so happens
that this feature set is related to facial attractiveness.

tindetheus let’s you build a database based on the profiles that you
like and dislike. You can then train a classification model to your
database. The model training first uses a MTCNN to detect and box the
faces in your database. Then a facenet model is run on the faces to
extract the embeddings (last layer of the CNN). A logistic regression
model is then fit to the embeddings. The logistic regression model is
saved, and this processes is repeated in automation to automatically
like and dislike profiles based on your historical preference.

This `blog
post <http://jekel.me/2018/Using-facenet-to-automatically-like-new-tinder-profiles/>`__
has a short description of how tindetheus works.

For a more detailed description of how and why this works see [1]
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04347

Example usage
=============

.. code:: bash

   tindetheus browse

build a database by liking and disliking profiles on Tinder. The
database contains all the profile information as a numpy array, while
the profile images are saved in a different folder.

.. code:: bash

   tindetheus browse --distance=20

by default tindetheus starts with a 5 mile radius, but you can specify a
search distance by specifying –distance. The above example is to start
with a 20 mile search radius. It is important to note that when you run
out of nearby users, tindethesus will ask you if you’d like to increase
the search distance by 5 miles.

.. code:: bash

   tindetheus train

Use machine learning to build a personalized model of who you like and
dislike based on your database. The more profiles you’ve browsed, the
better your model will be.

.. code:: bash

   tindetheus like

Use your personalized model to automatically like and dislike profiles.
The profiles which you have automatically liked and disliked are stored
in al_database. By default this will start with a 5 mile search radius,
which increases by 5 miles until you’ve used 100 likes. You can change
the default search radius by using

.. code:: bash

   tindetheus like --distance=20

which would start with a 20 mile search radius.

Installation and Getting started
================================

1. Create a new folder that will be your Tinder database.

   .. code:: bash

      mkdir tinder
      cd tinder

2. You need your facebook auth token. There are many discussions on this
   on the internet to find this. You can find your facebook auth token
   by using a man in the middle (MIM) attack to sniff out the requests.
   You are looking for *access_token=*. The MIM attack can be conducted
   by creating a proxy with ssl certificate. If you are still lost,
   perhaps check out `this <https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467>`__ or
   `this <http://www.joelotter.com/2015/05/17/dj-khaled-tinder-bot.html>`__.

3. Create a config.txt file that contains the following line exactly

   ::

      facebook_token = YYYY

   where YYYY is replaced with your facebook token in order to login using
   pynder. Alternatively you can use *XAuthToken =
   xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx* instead of facebook_token.

4. You need to initialize git in your *tinder* folder which is used to
   track revision history. Run the following commands to initialize git.

   .. code:: bash

      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "first commit"

5. Choose between a docker container or native setup for tindetheus. I’d
   highly recommend using the docker container as this is a dependency
   heavy library, but tindetheus will work either way you choose!

   -  `docker setup <#docker-setup>`__
   -  `native setup <#native-setup>`__

docker setup
------------

1. Add the *model_dir* line to the the config.txt file exactly as below.

   ::

      facebook_token = YYYY
      model_dir = /models/20170512-110547

   The docker container includes a pretrained facenet model (for more
   information read step 3 of `native setup <#native-setup>`__). You are
   welcome to experiment with other pretrained facenet models.

2. Get the docker container.

   .. code:: bash

      docker pull cjekel/tindetheus

3. Run the docker container while mounting the *tinder* directory to
   */mnt/tinder*

   .. code:: bash

      docker run -it -v /home/cj/tinder/:/mnt/tinder cjekel/tindetheus

   In this case */home/cj/tinder/* is the location of my *tinder* folder on
   my host machine. You should see something like the following when you
   run the docker container.

   .. code:: bash

      root@c4771abc41i9:/# 

4. cd into the mounted tinder folder

   .. code:: bash

      root@c4771abc41i9:/# cd /mnt/tinder

5. Start building your database. Manually reviewing 20-40 profiles will
   be a good starting point, but you can do it with less. Before you
   start training a model you have to be sure that you’ve liked and
   disliked at leach one profile.

   .. code:: bash

      tindetheus browse

   The profile images will show up in *tinder/temp_images*. To view these
   images open *tinder/temp_images* in the file explore on your host
   machine. This works best with large grid icons. Follow the command line
   instructions to like or dislike the profile.

6. Continue to `further instructions <#further-instructions>`__

native setup
------------

If you use Windows you may want to read this guide on `how to install
tindetheus on
Windows <http://jekel.me/2018/How-to-install-tindetheus-on-windows-10-to-automatically-like-users-on-tinder/>`__.

1. Install my pynder PR from source (pynder on pip has not been updated)

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder.git
      cd pynder
      git fetch origin +refs/pull/211/merge
      git checkout -qf FETCH_HEAD
      [sudo] python -m pip install .

2. Install tindetheus

   .. code:: bash

      [sudo] pip install tindetheus

3. Download a pretrained facenet model. I recommend using this model
   `20170512-110547 <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVZ2RpVDYwWmxoSUk/edit>`__
   `mirror <https://mega.nz/#!d6gxFL5b!ZLINGZKxdAQ-H7ZguAibd6GmXFXCcr39XxAvIjmTKew>`__.
   You must download 20170512-110547.zip and extract the contents in
   your *tinder* folder. The contents will be a folder named
   20170512-110547. You should specify the pretrained model that you use
   in the second line of the config.txt tile. You can use other
   `pretrained facenet
   models <https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet#pre-trained-models>`__
   as long as you include the model directory in your folder and change
   the config.txt accordingly.

4. Start building your database. Manually reviewing 20-40 profiles will
   be a good starting point, but you can do it with less. Before you
   start training a model you have to be sure that you’ve liked and
   disliked at leach one profile.

   .. code:: bash

      tindetheus browse

   The profile images will show up in a window. Follow the command line
   instructions to like or dislike the profile.

further instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5. After browsing profiles you can train your personalized
   classification model at any time. (Make sure you have liked and
   disliked at least one profile each before running!) Just run

   .. code:: bash

      tindetheus train

   to build your personalized model. With more profiles you can build a
   more accurate model, so feel free to browse more profiles at any time
   and build to your database. Newly browsed profiles aren’t automatically
   added to the model, so you must manually run tindetheus train to update
   your model.

6. You can automatically like and dislike profiles based on your trained
   model. To do this simply run

   .. code:: bash

      tindetheus like

   which will use your latest trained model to automatically like and
   dislike profiles. The application will start with a 5 mile search
   radius, and automatically like and dislike the people in this radius.
   After running out of people, the search radius is increased by 5 miles
   and the processes repeats. This goes on until you’ve used 100 likes, at
   which point the application stops.

7. This is all in the early stages, so after each session I highly
   recommend you backup your *tinder* folder by creating an archive of
   the folder.

8. If you want to manually browse your database, check out this
   `example <https://github.com/cjekel/tindetheus/blob/master/examples/open_database.py>`__
   file.

config.txt
==========

You can now store all default optional parameters in the config.txt!
This means you can set your starting distance, number of likes, and
image_batch size without manually specifying the options each time. This
is an example config.txt file:

::

   facebook_token = XXXXXXX  # your facebook token hash
   # alternatively you can use the XAuthToken
   XAuthToken = xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx
   model_dir = 20170512-110547  # the location of your facenet model directory
   # see https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet#pre-trained-models for other
   # pretrained facenet models
   image_batch = 1000  # number of images to load in a batch during train
   #  the larger the image_batch size, the faster the training process, at the
   #  cost of additional memory. A 4GB machine may struggle with 1000 images.
   distance = 5  # Set the starting distance in miles
   likes = 100  # set the number of likes you want to use
   #  note that free Tinder users only get 100 likes in 24 hours

Using the validate function on a different dataset
==================================================

As of Version 0.4.0, tindetheus now includes a validate function. This
validate functions applies your personally trained tinder model on an
external set of images. If there is a face in the image, the model will
predict whether you will like or dislike this face. The results are
saved in validation.csv.

First you’ll need to get a validation data set. I’ve created a small
subset of the `hot or not
database <http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/rationales/>`__ for
testing purposes. You can download the validation.zip
`here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/13cNUzP_eXKsq8ABHwXHn4b9UgRbk-5oP/view?usp=sharing>`__
which is a a subset of the female images in [2], and extract it to your
tinder database directory.

Then execute

::

   tindetheus validate

to run the pretrained tindetheus model on your validation image set. You
could run the tindetheus trained model on the entire hot or not database
to give you an idea of how your model reacts in the wild. Note that
validate will attempt to rate each face in your image database, while
tindetheus only considers the images with just one face.

The validate function only looks at images within folders in the
validation folder. All images directly within the validation folder will
be ignored. The following directory structure considers the images in
the validation/females and validation/movie_stars directories.

::

   my_tinder_project
   │   config.txt
   |   validation.csv
   │
   └───validation
   |   |   this_image_ignored.jpg
   │   │
   │   └───females
   │   │   │   image00.jpg
   │   │   │   image01.jpg
   │   │   │   ...
   │   └───movie_stars
   │       │   image00.jpg
   │       │   image01.jpg
   │       │   ...

tindetheus uses the following open source libraries:

-  `pynder <https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder>`__
-  `facenet <https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet>`__
-  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__

About the name
==============

Tindetheus is a combination of Tinder (the popular online dating
application) and the Greek Titans:
`Prometheus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus>`__ and
`Epimetheus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(mythology)>`__.
Prometheus signifies “forethought,” while his brother Epimetheus denotes
“afterthought”. In synergy they serve to improve your Tinder experience.

Epimetheus creates a database from all of the profiles you review on
Tinder.

Prometheus learns from your historical preferences to automatically like
new Tinder profiles.
