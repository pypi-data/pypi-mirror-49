This cube models multipart email messages (`Emails` and `EmailPart`) and
provides tools to import your mail box into a cubicweb instance.

Email are automatically stored into`EmailThreads`.

It also comes with a command line tool to import emails (mbox) files
in a CubicWeb instance. This tool is based on cwclientlib_, so
connection credentials to the cubicweb instance should be stored in
your ~/.config/cwclientlibrc file.
