.. class:: CosiModel

   A dempgraphic model for Africa, Asia and Europe, as described in 
   Schaffner et al, Genome Research, 2005, and implemented in the coalescent
   simulator cosi.

   .. method:: CosiModel.CosiModel(T0, N_A=12500, N_AF=24000, N_OoA=7700, N_AF1=100000, N_AS1=100000, N_EU1=100000, T_AF=17000, T_OoA=3500, T_EU_AS=2000, T_AS_exp=400, T_EU_exp=350, T_AF_exp=200, F_OoA=0.085, F_AS=0.067, F_EU=0.02, F_AF=0.02, m_AF_EU=3.2e-05, m_AF_AS=8e-06, ops=[], infoFields=[], scale=1)

      Counting **backward in time**, this model evolves a population for a
      total of ``T0`` generations. The ancient population ``Ancestral`` started
      at size ``N_Ancestral`` and expanded at ``T_AF`` generations from now,
      to pop ``AF`` with size ``N_AF``. The Out of Africa population split from
      the ``AF`` population at ``T_OoA`` generations ago. The ``OoA`` population
      split into two subpopulations ``AS`` and ``EU`` but keep the same size.
      At the generations of ``T_EU_exp``, ``T_AS_exp``, and ``T_AF_exp`` ago,
      three populations expanded to modern population sizes of ``N_AF1``, 
      ``N_AS1`` and ``N_EU1`` exponentially, respectively. Migrations are
      allowed between ``AF`` and ``EU`` populations
      with rate ``m_AF_EU``, and between ``AF`` and ``AS`` with rate ``m_AF_AS``.
      
      Four bottlenecks happens in the ``AF``, ``OoA``, ``EU`` and ``AS`` populations.
      They are supposed to happen 200 generations after population split and last
      for 200 generations. The intensity is parameterized in F, which is number
      of generations devided by twice the effective size during bottleneck.
      So the bottleneck size is 100/F. 
      
      This model merges all subpopulations if it is applied to a population with
      multiple subpopulation. Although parameters are configurable, we assume
      the order of events so dramatically changes of parameters might need
      to errors.  If a scaling factor ``scale`` is specified, all population
      sizes and generation numbers will be divided by, and migration rates
      will be multiplied by a factor of ``scale``.

   .. method:: CosiModel.plot(filename='', title='', initSize=[])

      Evolve a haploid population using a :class:`RandomSelection` mating scheme
      using the demographic model. Print population size changes duringe evolution.
      An initial population size could be specified using parameter ``initSize``
      for a demographic model with dynamic initial population size. If a filename
      is specified and if matplotlib is available, this function draws a figure
      to depict the demographic model and save it to ``filename``. An optional
      ``title`` could be specified to the figure. Note that this function can
      not be plot demographic models that works for particular mating schemes
      (e.g. genotype dependent).
