""" Performs second-preimage attack against Merkle-trees of all possible hash- and encoding-types
for *both* possible security modes. Attack should succeed only when the tree's security mode is
deactiveated (i.e., *iff* its ``.security`` attribute is ``False`` by construction).

Concatenate the hashes stored by the 3-rd and 4-th leaves and append the result (i.e., its digest)
as the 3-rd leaf, leaving the 1-st and 2-nd leaves untouched
