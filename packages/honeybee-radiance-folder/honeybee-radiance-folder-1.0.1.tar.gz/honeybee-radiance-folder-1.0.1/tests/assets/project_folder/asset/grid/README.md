# Sensor grid

`/asset/grid`

Copy all the sensor grids in your model to this folder as separate files. Sensor grids
file extension should end up with `.pts`. Each line includes a single sensor. The first 3
values describe the position of the sensor and the second 3 values describe sensor's
direction.

```
position_x1  position_y1  position_z1  direction_x1  direction_y1  direction_z1
position_x2  position_y2  position_z2  direction_x2  direction_y2  direction_z2
```
