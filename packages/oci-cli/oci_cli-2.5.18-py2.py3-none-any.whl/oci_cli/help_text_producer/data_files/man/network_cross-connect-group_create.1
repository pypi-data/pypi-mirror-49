.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new cross\-connect group to use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see \fI\%FastConnect Overview\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the cross\-connect group to reside. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the cross\-connect group in the same compartment with your VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the cross\-connect group. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|PROVISIONED|INACTIVE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
