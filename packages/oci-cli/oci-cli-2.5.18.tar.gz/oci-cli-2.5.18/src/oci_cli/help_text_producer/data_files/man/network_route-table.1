.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A collection of \fIRouteRule\fP objects, which are used to route packets based on destination IP to a particular network entity. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new route table for the specified VCN. In the request you must also include at least one route rule for the new route table. For information on the number of rules you can have in a route table, see \fI\%Service Limits\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm\fP>\&. For general information about route tables in your VCN and the types of targets you can use in route rules, see \fI\%Route Tables\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the route table to reside. Notice that the route table doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the route table in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the route table, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
