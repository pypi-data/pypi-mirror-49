This code uses [Qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) to interactively display the frequency solution.  Follow their [installation instructions](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) to make sure that runs, making sure to enable the notebook extensions specifically.

This is a serious work in progress with many planned improvements.  Please be patient.
