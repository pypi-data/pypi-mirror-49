EPYNET is an object oriented wrapper around the EPANET 2.1 community edition hydraulic network solver.

## Features
- [x] Hydraulic calculations
- [x] Object oriented access to Nodes, Junctions, Reservoirs, Tanks, Links, Pipes, Valves and Pumps
- [x] Convienent access to simulation results such as flow, velocity and pressure through class properties
- [x] Manipulation of valve and pump settings
- [x] Manipulation of pipe, junction, reservoir and tank settings
- [x] Support for time series
- [x] Pattern and Curve creation and manipulation
- [x] Create and remove nodes and links
- [x] Work on multiple networks at the same time
- [ ] [TODO] Chemical calculations

## Example Usage
```python
# load a network
from epynet import Network
network = Network('network.inp')
# solve network
network.solve()
# properties
print(network.pipes['4'].flow)
print(network.nodes['1'].demand)
# valve manipulation
network.valves['12'].setting = 10
# convinience properties
print(network.pipes['5'].downstream_node.pressure)
print(network.nodes['1'].upstream_links[0].velocity)
# pandas integration
print(network.pipes.flow)
print(network.pipes.length[network.pipes.velocity > 1])
print(network.nodes.demand[network.nodes.pressure < 10].max())
# network manipulaton
network.add_tank('tankid', x=10, y=10, elevation=10)
network.add_junction('junctionid', x=20, y=10, elevation=5)
network.add_pipe('tankid', 'junctionid', length=10, diameter=200, roughness=0.1)
```
