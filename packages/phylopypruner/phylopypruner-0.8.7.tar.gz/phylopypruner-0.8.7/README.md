## What is PhyloPyPruner?

PhyloPyPruner is a Python package for refining the output of a graph-based
orthology inference approach such as
[OrthoMCL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952885),
[OrthoFinder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243257) or
[HaMStR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19586527). Similar to other
tree-based orthology inference methods (e.g.,
[PhyloTreePruner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825643/),
[UPhO](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/8/2117/2578877),
[Agalma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840672/) and
[Phylogenomic Dataset
Reconstruction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158799)), it
uses phylogenetic trees in order to obtain genes that are 1:1 orthologous. In
addition to filters and algorithms seen in pre-existing tools, this package
provides new methods for differentiating [contamination-like
sequences](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner/wikis/About-PhyloPyPruner#contamination-like-issues-)
from paralogs.

PhyloPyPruner is under active development and I would appreciate it if you try
this software on your own data and [leave
feedback](mailto:felix.thalen@uni-goettingen.de).

## Quick installation

The easiest way to install PhyloPyPruner is by using the package manager for
Python, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install phylopypruner # install for all users
pip install --user phylopypruner # install for the current user only
```

Once installed, the program is located within `$HOME/.local/bin`. Depending on
your OS, you might have to add the directory to your `$PATH` to avoid typing
the entire path. Once in your path, you run the program like this:

```bash
phylopypruner
```
