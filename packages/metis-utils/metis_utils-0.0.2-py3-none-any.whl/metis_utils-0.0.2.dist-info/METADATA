# Metis Utils

This is a collection of utility functions to help speed you through the OSEMN (obtain - scrub - explore - model - interpret) lifecycle of data science project development.

[Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com) is a data science education company with campuses in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, and corporate training services throughout the U.S. The `metis-utils` package is a collection of some our favorite scripts and functions that we use to teach data science in our bootcamps, and to help students to rapidly put together prototypes for their data science projects. We hope that the included modules will boost your productivity, and that reading through the source code will deepen your understanding of data science best practices!
