.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An object you create when setting up an IPSec VPN between your on\-premises network and VCN. The \fICpe\fP is a virtual representation of your customer\-premises equipment, which is the actual router on\-premises at your site at your end of the IPSec VPN connection. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new virtual customer\-premises equipment (CPE) object in the specified compartment. For more information, see \fI\%IPSec VPNs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec connection or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must provide the public IP address of your on\-premises router. See \fI\%Configuring Your On\-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the CPE, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment to contain the CPE. [required]
.SS \-\-ip\-address [text]
.sp
The public IP address of the on\-premises router.
.sp
Example: \fI143.19.23.16\fP [required]
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
