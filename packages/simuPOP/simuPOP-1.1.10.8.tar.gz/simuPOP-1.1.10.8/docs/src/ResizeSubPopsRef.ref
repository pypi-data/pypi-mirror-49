class ResizeSubPops
-------------------

.. class:: ResizeSubPops

   This operator resizes subpopulations to specified sizes.
   individuals are added or removed depending on the new subpopulation
   sizes.


   .. method:: ResizeSubPops(subPops=ALL_AVAIL, sizes=[], proportions=[], propagate=True, begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Resize given subpopulations *subPops* to new sizes *size*, or
      sizes proportional to original sizes (parameter *proportions*).
      All subpopulations will be resized if *subPops* is not
      specified. If the new size of a subpopulation is smaller than
      its original size, extra individuals will be removed. If the new
      size is larger, new individuals with empty genotype will be
      inserted, unless parameter *propagate* is set to ``True``
      (default). In this case, existing individuals will be copied
      sequentially, and repeatedly if needed.

      Please refer to operator :class:`BaseOperator` for a detailed
      explanation for all parameters.
