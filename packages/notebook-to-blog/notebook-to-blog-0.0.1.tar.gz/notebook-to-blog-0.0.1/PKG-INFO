Description: # Notebook to Blog
        
        ## Overview
        
        **Notebook to Blog** is a Python CLI that makes it easy to go from a Jupyter Notebook to the following outputs:
        - A .txt file containing blog text and placeholders
        - Images of plots (saved locally)
        - Github Gists
        
        While not completely automated, this will make it much easier to create a blog post (e.g., Medium).
        
        ## Instructions
        
        1. Install via `pip install notebook-to-blog`.
        2. Store your Github username/password somewhere in your filesystem:
        
        ```
        GITHUB_USER=<username>
        GITHUB_PASSWORD=<password>
        ```
        3. Run via `notebook_to_blog <path to Jupyter notebook> <path to output directory> <path to Github credentials>`
        
        For example, running `notebook_to_blog my_notebook.ipynb output .env` will create the following files:
        
        ```
        output/
          my_notebok.txt
          images/
            image_00.png
        ```
        
        In addition, Github Gists will be created for each code block encountered.
        
        **my_notebook.txt** looks like the following:
        
        ```
        Whatever you wrote in Markdown will appear as regular text. Code blocks will cause Github Gists to be created, and a link to be inserted:

        Images will also be represented as placeholder text:
        
        <INSERT img_04.png>
        ```
