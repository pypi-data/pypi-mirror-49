Description: This command represents a faster alternative to ``git add -i`` or ``git gui``.
        It allows you to stage or unstage files from the index in an editor, just like
        when you perform an interactive rebase.
        
        For example, let's assume you have the following three modified files (``git
        status --short``):
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
            M path/to/file1
            M another/path/to/file2
            M yet/another/path/to/file3
        
        After running ``git edit-index``, an editor will show up with the above output.
        To stage (add) the first two files, simply change the text to
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
            A path/to/file1
            A another/path/to/file2
            M yet/another/path/to/file3
        
        The supported statuses are ``M``, ``A``, ``D``, and ``?``. They allow you to
        not only stage files but also unstage them, delete them, or revert changes done
        to them since the last commit.

        more information.
