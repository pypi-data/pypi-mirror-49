.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp

.SS \-\-db\-name [text]
.sp
The database name. The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of 14 alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. The database name must be unique in the tenancy. [required]
.SS \-\-cpu\-core\-count [integer]
.sp
The number of CPU Cores to be made available to the database. [required]
.SS \-\-data\-storage\-size\-in\-tbs [integer]
.sp
The size, in terabytes, of the data volume that will be created and attached to the database. This storage can later be scaled up if needed. [required]
.SS \-\-admin\-password [text]
.sp
The password must be between 12 and 30 characters long, and must contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 numeric character. It cannot contain the double quote symbol (") or the username "admin", regardless of casing. [required]
.SS \-\-source\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the source Autonomous Database that you will clone to create a new Autonomous Database. [required]
.SS \-\-clone\-type [FULL|METADATA]
.sp
The clone type. [required]
.SS \-\-db\-workload [OLTP|DW]
.sp
The autonomous database workload type. OLTP indicates an Autonomous Transaction Processing database and DW indicates an Autonomous Data Warehouse. The default is OLTP.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
The user\-friendly name for the Autonomous Database. The name does not have to be unique.
.SS \-\-license\-model [LICENSE_INCLUDED|BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE]
.sp
The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. The default is BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE.
.SS \-\-is\-preview\-version\-with\-service\-terms\-accepted [boolean]
.sp
If set to true, indicates that an Autonomous Database preview version is being provisioned, and that the preview version\(aqs terms of service have been accepted.
.SS \-\-is\-auto\-scaling\-enabled [boolean]
.sp
Indicates if auto scaling is enabled for the Autonomous Database CPU core count. The default value is false.
.SS \-\-is\-dedicated [boolean]
.sp
True if it is dedicated database.
.SS \-\-autonomous\-container\-database\-id [text]
.sp
The Autonomous Container Database \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|STOPPING|STOPPED|STARTING|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|UNAVAILABLE|RESTORE_IN_PROGRESS|RESTORE_FAILED|BACKUP_IN_PROGRESS|SCALE_IN_PROGRESS|AVAILABLE_NEEDS_ATTENTION|UPDATING|MAINTENANCE_IN_PROGRESS]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
