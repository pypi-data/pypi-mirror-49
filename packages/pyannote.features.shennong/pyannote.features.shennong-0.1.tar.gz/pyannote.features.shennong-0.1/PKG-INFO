Description: # pyannote-shennong-features
        A feature extractor for Pyannote that is based on the Shennong library
        
        ## Installation
        
        This library depends on Shennong, which is available on conda. 
        Thus, make sure you're in a conda environment **where pyannote-audio has been installed already** and run
        
        ```yaml
        conda install -c coml shennong
        ```
        
        Then you can pip-install the library in a regular way:
        
        ```
        pip install pyannote.features.shennong
        ```
        
        ## Pyannote Configuration
        
        To use features from this library, this is the kind of configuration you
        should add your `config.yml` file:
        
        ```yaml
        feature_extraction:
           name: pyannote.features.ShennongMfcc
           params:
               coefs: 19
               e: True
               D: True
               DD: True
               mfccWindowType: 'hanning'
               mfccLowFreq: 20
               mfccHighFreq: -100 # Real value will be (f_nyquist - 100)
               with_pitch: True
               with_cmvn: False
               duration: 0.025
