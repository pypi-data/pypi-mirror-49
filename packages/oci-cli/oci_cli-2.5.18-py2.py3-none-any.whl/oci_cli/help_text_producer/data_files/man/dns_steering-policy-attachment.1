.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An attachment between a steering policy and a domain. An attachment constructs DNS responses using its steering policy instead of the records at its defined domain. Only records of the policy\(aqs covered rtype are blocked at the domain. A domain can have a maximum of one attachment covering any given rtype.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new attachment between a steering policy and a domain, giving the policy permission to answer queries for the specified domain. A steering policy must be attached to a domain for the policy to answer DNS queries for that domain.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, the attachment is automatically placed into the same compartment as the domain\(aqs zone.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-steering\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the attached steering policy. [required]
.SS \-\-zone\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the attached zone. [required]
.SS \-\-domain\-name [text]
.sp
The attached domain within the attached zone. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the steering policy attachment. Does not have to be unique and can be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
