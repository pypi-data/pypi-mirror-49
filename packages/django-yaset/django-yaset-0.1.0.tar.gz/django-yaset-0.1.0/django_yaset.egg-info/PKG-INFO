        ************
        
        Yet Another Settings tool for django contains helper functions for managing
        localized settings files for different deployments and developers.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install django-yaset
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        A common pattern in django to use different settings for different
        environments is to have a "local_settings" directory. This utility makes this
        easier. 
        
        The expected directory setup is as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
            project/
                settings.py
                local_settings/
                    __init__.py
                    import_redirect
                    development.py
                    production.py
                    secrets/
                        __init__.py
                        development.py
                        production.py
                        
        
        The ``import_redirect`` file should contain the local module name of the
        settings to import in this environment. In the above example, it would be
        either "development" or "production". The "devleopment" and "production" files
        would contain the same types of declarations found in ``settings.py``.
        
        Inside of your ``settings.py`` file, include this at the bottom:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from yaset import import_settings
        
            import_settings(globals())
        
        This passes the ``settings`` packaging into the ``import_settings`` call which
        loads ``import_redirect``, uses its contents to then load the
        ``local_settings`` and ``local_settings.secrets`` files specified. 
        
        It is not generally recommended to put either the ``import_redirect`` file or
        the ``secrets`` directory in your repository.
