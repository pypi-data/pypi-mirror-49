.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An instance\(aqs serial console data. It includes configuration messages that occur when the instance boots, such as kernel and BIOS messages, and is useful for checking the status of the instance or diagnosing problems. The console data is minimally formatted ASCII text.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS capture
.SS Description
.sp
Captures the most recent serial console data (up to a megabyte) for the specified instance.
.sp
The \fICaptureConsoleHistory\fP operation works with the other console history operations as described below.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Use \fICaptureConsoleHistory\fP to request the capture of up to a megabyte of the most recent console history. This call returns a \fIConsoleHistory\fP object. The object will have a state of REQUESTED. 2. Wait for the capture operation to succeed by polling \fIGetConsoleHistory\fP with the identifier of the console history metadata. The state of the \fIConsoleHistory\fP object will go from REQUESTED to GETTING\-HISTORY and then SUCCEEDED (or FAILED). 3. Use \fIGetConsoleHistoryContent\fP to get the actual console history data (not the metadata). 4. Optionally, use \fIDeleteConsoleHistory\fP to delete the console history metadata and the console history data.

.SS \-\-instance\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the instance to get the console history from. [required]
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [REQUESTED|GETTING\-HISTORY|SUCCEEDED|FAILED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
