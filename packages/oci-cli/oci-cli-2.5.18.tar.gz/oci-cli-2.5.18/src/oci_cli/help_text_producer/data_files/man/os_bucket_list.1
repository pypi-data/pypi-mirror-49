.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gets a list of all BucketSummary items in a compartment. A BucketSummary contains only summary fields for the bucket and does not contain fields like the user\-defined metadata.
.sp
To use this and other API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The ID of the compartment in which to list buckets. [required]
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of items to return.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The page at which to start retrieving results.
.SS \-\-fields [tags]
.sp
Bucket summary in list of buckets includes the \(aqnamespace\(aq, \(aqname\(aq, \(aqcompartmentId\(aq, \(aqcreatedBy\(aq, \(aqtimeCreated\(aq, and \(aqetag\(aq fields. This parameter can also include \(aqtags\(aq (freeformTags and definedTags). The only supported value of this parameter is \(aqtags\(aq for now. Example \(aqtags\(aq.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
