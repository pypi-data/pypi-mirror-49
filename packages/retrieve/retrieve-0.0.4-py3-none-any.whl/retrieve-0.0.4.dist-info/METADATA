![Code Sample](https://i.imgur.com/2vSkGIB.png)

No-frills library to download pre-trained models, cache it and return the local path.

## Motivation
When using pre-trained ML models in your projects, majority of them require you to manually download the data/model weights and then specify the path in your code. Everyone in your team has to go through the same trouble of manually setting this up before they can run your models.

The idea with this library is automate this and make using pre-trained models as easy as possible.

## Installation
```
pip install -U retrieve
```
