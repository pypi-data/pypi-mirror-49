class BasePenetrance
--------------------

.. class:: BasePenetrance

   A penetrance model models the probability that an individual has a
   certain disease provided that he or she has certain genetic
   (genotype) and environmental (information field) riske factors. A
   penetrance operator calculates this probability according to
   provided information and set his or her affection status randomly.
   For example, an individual will have probability 0.8 to be affected
   if the penetrance is 0.8. This class is the base class to all
   penetrance operators and defines a common interface for all
   penetrance operators.

   A penetrance operator can be applied at any stage of an
   evolutionary cycle. If it is applied before or after mating, it
   will set affection status of all parents and offspring,
   respectively. If it is applied during mating, it will set the
   affection status of each offspring. You can also apply a penetrance
   operator to an individual using its ``applyToIndividual`` member
   function.

   By default, a penetrance operator assigns affection status of
   individuals but does not save the actual penetrance value. However,
   if an information field is specified, penetrance values will be
   saved to this field for future analysis.

   When a penetrance operator is applied to a population, it is only
   applied to the current generation. You can, however, use parameter
   *ancGens* to set affection status for all ancestral generations
   (``ALL_AVAIL``), or individuals in specified generations if a list
   of ancestral generations is specified. Note that this parameter is
   ignored if the operator is applied during mating.


   .. method:: BasePenetrance(ancGens=UNSPECIFIED, begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a base penetrance operator. This operator assign
      individual affection status in the present generation (default).
      If ``ALL_AVAIL`` or a list of ancestral generations are spcified
      in parameter *ancGens*, individuals in specified ancestral
      generations will be processed. A penetrance operator can be
      applied to specified (virtual) subpopulations (parameter
      *subPops*) and replicates (parameter *reps*). If an informatio
      field is given, penetrance value will be stored in this
      information field of each individual.


   .. method:: BasePenetrance.apply(pop)

      set penetrance to all individuals and record penetrance if
      requested

   .. method:: BasePenetrance.applyToIndividual(ind, pop=None)

      Apply the penetrance operator to a single individual *ind* and
      set his or her affection status. A population reference can be
      passed if the penetrance model depends on population properties
      such as generation number. This function returns the affection
      status.
