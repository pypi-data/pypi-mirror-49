.g-body-title Export a folder to a tape archive (TAR) file
.g-body-subtitle= assetstore.name()

p.
  Use this page to export a Girder folder to a tape archive (TAR) file for backup or cold
  storage purposes. This will not change the view of the folder or its files in Girder in any way,
  and the file will still be able to be downloaded. However, there will be a higher latency for
  downloading files that reside in a tape archive due to the latency of reading the archive
  index to look up the file. There may also be an additional very large latency if the underlying
  tape archive service has moved the file from the staging filesystem to a physical tape,
  which happens automatically and asynchronously.
p.
  This is an incremental operation; if you run it on a folder under which some files are already
  residing in a tape archive, those files will be skipped. Only files that are not already
  archived will be added to the new tape archive file.
