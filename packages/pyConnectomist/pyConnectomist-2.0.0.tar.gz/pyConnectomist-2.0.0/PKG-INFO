Description: pyConnectomist 
        
        Python wrappers for Connectomist: wrap the Connectomist software and simplify scripting calls. Each preprocessing, tractography and labeling step (i.e. one Connectomist tab) can be run through the use of a dedicated function of the package.
        
        pyConnectomist, developed by the NeuroSpin software platform, is a wrapping of the Connectomist software developped by the `UNIRS team <http://i2bm.cea.fr/drf/i2bm/Pages/NeuroSpin/UNIRS/Presentation.aspx>`. It is meant to be run as part of a research collaboration or a charged service. For more information about its terms of use, please contact Cyril Poupon and Vincent Frouin.
