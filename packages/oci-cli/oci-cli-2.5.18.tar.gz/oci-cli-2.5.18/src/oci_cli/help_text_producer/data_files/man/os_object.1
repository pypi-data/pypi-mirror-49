.SS Options
.SS \-ns, \-\-namespace, \-\-namespace\-name [text]
.sp
The top\-level namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-bn, \-\-bucket\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. [required]
.SS \-\-prefix [text]
.sp
Delete all objects with the given prefix. Omit this parameter to delete all objects in the bucket.
.SS \-\-delimiter [text]
.sp
When this parameter is set, only objects whose names do not contain the delimiter character (after an optionally specified prefix) are deleted. Scanned objects whose names contain the delimiter have part of their name up to the last occurrence of the delimiter (after the optional prefix) returned as a set of prefixes. Note: Only \(aq/\(aq is a supported delimiter character at this time.
.SS \-\-dry\-run
.sp
Displays a list of objects which would be deleted by this command, if it were run without \-\-dry\-run. If \-\-dry\-run is passed, no objects will actually be deleted.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Do not ask for confirmation prior to performing the bulk delete.
.SS \-\-parallel\-operations\-count [integer]
.sp
The number of parallel operations to perform. Decreasing this value will make bulk deletes less resource intensive but they may take longer. Increasing this value may improve bulk delete times, but the upload process will consume more system resources and network bandwidth. [default: 10]
.SS \-\-include [text]
.sp
Only delete objects which match the provided pattern. Patterns are taken relative to the bucket root. This option can be provided mulitple times to match on mulitple patterns. Supported pattern symbols are:
.sp
*: Matches everything
.sp
?: Matches any single character
.sp
[sequence]: Matches any character in sequence
.sp
[!sequence]: Matches any character not in sequence
.SS \-\-exclude [text]
.sp
Only download objects which do not match the provided pattern. Patterns are taken relative to the bucket root. This option can be provided mulitple times to match on mulitple patterns. Supported pattern symbols are:

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

Specifying this flag will also allow for faster uploads as the CLI will not initially check whether or not the files already exist in Object Storage.

.SS put
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new object or overwrites an existing one.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is being uploaded from STDIN, it will be uploaded as a multipart upload (if the object content is smaller than \-\-part\-size, default for STDIN is 10 MiB, the multipart upload may contain only one part, but it will still use the MultipartUpload API)
.IP \(bu 2
If the \-\-no\-multipart flag is specified, the object will be uploaded as a single part regardless of size (specifying \-\-no\-multipart when uploading from STDIN will result in an error)
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is larger than \-\-part\-size, it will be uploaded as multiple parts (the default part size is 128 MiB)
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is empty it will be uploaded as a single part
