Description: ## No more development
        Unfortunately I do not have access to my Midea Air Conditioners as I have relocated to a new house. This means that I cannot reliably support this library due to not being able to test it with real hardware anymore.
        
        # midea-ac-py 
        
        This is a library to allow communicating to a Midea AC via the Midea Cloud.
        
        This is a very early release, and comes without any guarantees. This is still an early work in progress and simply serves as a proof of concept.
        
        This library would not have been possible if it wasn't for the amazing work done by @yitsushi and his Ruby based command line tool. 
        You can find his work here: https://github.com/yitsushi/midea-air-condition
        The reasons for me converting this to Python is that this library also serves as a platform component for Home Assistant.
