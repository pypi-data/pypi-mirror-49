.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A PEM\-format RSA credential for securing requests to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API. Also known as an \fIAPI signing key\fP\&. Specifically, this is the public key from the key pair. The private key remains with the user calling the API. For information about generating a key pair in the required PEM format, see \fI\%Required Keys and OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP This is \fBnot\fP the SSH key for accessing compute instances.
.sp
Each user can have a maximum of three API signing keys.
.sp
For more information about user credentials, see \fI\%User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/usercredentials.htm\fP>\&.

.SS delete
.SS Description
.sp
Deletes the specified API signing key for the specified user.
.sp
Every user has permission to use this operation to delete a key for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to delete a key for any user, including themselves.
.SS Usage

.SS Options
.SS \-\-user\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the user. [required]
.SS \-\-fingerprint [text]
.sp
The key\(aqs fingerprint. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS list
.SS Description
.sp
Lists the API signing keys for the specified user. A user can have a maximum of three keys.
.sp
Every user has permission to use this API call for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&.  An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability.

.SS upload
.SS Description
.sp
Uploads an API signing key for the specified user.
.sp
Every user has permission to use this operation to upload a key for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to upload a key for any user, including themselves.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Even though you have permission to upload an API key, you might not yet have permission to do much else. If you try calling an operation unrelated to your own credential management (e.g., \fIListUsers\fP, \fILaunchInstance\fP) and receive an "unauthorized" error, check with an administrator to confirm which IAM Service group(s) you\(aqre in and what access you have. Also confirm you\(aqre working in the correct compartment.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
