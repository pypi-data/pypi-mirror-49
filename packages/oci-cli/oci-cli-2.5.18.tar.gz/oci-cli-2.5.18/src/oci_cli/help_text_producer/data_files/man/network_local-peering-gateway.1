.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN peer with another VCN in the same region. \fIPeering\fP means that the two VCNs can communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing the internet or routing through your on\-premises network. For more information, see \fI\%VCN Peering\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Connects this local peering gateway (LPG) to another one in the same region.
.sp
This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is designated as the \fIrequestor\fP in the peering relationship. The \fIacceptor\fP must implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that gives the requestor permission to connect to LPGs in the acceptor\(aqs compartment. Without that permission, this operation will fail. For more information, see \fI\%VCN Peering\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-local\-peering\-gateway\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the local peering gateway. [required]
.SS \-\-peer\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the LPG you want to peer with. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.SS \-\-route\-table\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the route table the LPG will use.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a route table here, the LPG is created without an associated route table. The Networking service does NOT automatically associate the attached VCN\(aqs default route table with the LPG.
.sp
For information about why you would associate a route table with an LPG, see \fI\%Advanced Scenario: Transit Routing\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm\fP>\&.
