# pygpc
A Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis toolbox for Python based on the generalized polynomial chaos method

Basic features:
---------------
- Highly efficient **uncertainty analysis of N-dimensional systems** with arbitrary number of quantities of interest
- Sensitivity analysis using **Sobol indices** and **Global derivative based sensitivity indices**
- Easy **coupling** to user defined models (also outside of Python) 
- Included **parallelization** concept allows to run model evaluations in parallel
- Highly efficient **adaptive algorithms** allow for analysis of complex systems
- Supports **GPUs (CUDA)** to significantly accelerate algorithmic and post-processing routines for high-dimensional and complex problems
- Includes **state-of-the-art techniques** such as:
    - **Projection:** determination of optimal reduced basis
    - **l1-minimization:** reduction of necessary model evaluations by making use of concepts from compressed sensing  
    - **Gradient enhanced gPC:** use of gradient information of the model function to increase accuracy
    - **Multi-element gPC:** analyzing systems with discontinuities and sharp transitions
    
Installation
------------
pygpc can be installed via the `pip` command with Python >= 3.6 and then simply run the following line from a terminal:
```
pip install pygpc
```
Alternatively, it is possible to clone this repository and run the setup manually. This requires Cython to compile the C-extensions and Numpy for some headers. You can get Cython and Numpy by running the following command:
```
pip install cython numpy
```
Alternatively you can install the build dependencies with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Afterwards, pygpc can be installed by running the following line from the directory in which the repository was cloned:
```
python setup.py install
```
