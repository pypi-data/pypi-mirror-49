.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An instance configuration is a template that defines the settings to use when creating Compute instances as part of an instance pool. For more information about instance pools and instance configurations, see \fI\%Managing Compute Instances\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/instancemanagement.htm\fP>\&.

.SS change\-compartment
.SS Description
.sp
Moves an instance configuration into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Most of the properties for an existing instance configuration, including the compartment, cannot be modified after you create the instance configuration. Although you can move an instance configuration to a different compartment, you will not be able to use the instance configuration to manage instance pools in the new compartment. If you want to update an instance configuration to point to a different compartment, you should instead create a new instance configuration in the target compartment using \fI\%CreateInstanceConfiguration\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/InstanceConfiguration/CreateInstanceConfiguration\fP>\&.

.SS \-\-instance\-configuration\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the instance configuration. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment to move the instance configuration to. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
