.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) credentials are needed to send email through Email Delivery. The SMTP credentials are used for SMTP authentication with the service. The credentials never expire. A user can have up to 2 SMTP credentials at a time.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The credential set is always an Oracle\-generated SMTP user name and password pair; you cannot designate the SMTP user name or the SMTP password.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Managing User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description

You must specify a \fIdescription\fP for the SMTP credential (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateSmtpCredential\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/SmtpCredentialSummary/UpdateSmtpCredential\fP>\&.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp

.SS \-\-user\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the user. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
