Description: A comprehensive library to tackle the issues of Physical constants and conversions required from time to time for scientific computations. Taking from gravity to gravitation constants to reaching the horizons of micro-level values it can handle issues for Bohr-radius, electronic charge and mass. It can also handle thermodynamic components like Boltzmann constants. Work is under progress to enhance the umbrella of physics based conversions.
        
        All the constants' value has been taken reference from: http://web.mit.edu/birge/Public/formulas/phys-const.pdf
