Description: # SCOTUS Data Tools
        
        Welcome to SCOTUS Data Tools and Utils!  This is a work in progress.
        
        ## Intro & Objectives
        
        The primary purpose of this package is to create a set of tools that is capabile of:
        
        + Retrieving base SCOTUS data (e.g. case texts from https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes.aspx and case transcriptions from http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/terms/)
        + Retrieving auxiliary SCOTUS data (not sure what this includes yet?)
        + Extracting & Segmenting texts from source documents
            + For Bound Volumes, this means extracting text from PDF and segmenting by case
            + Transcripts may involve getting the text from the PDFs and segmenting by speaker, perhaps
            + Other sources may have more involved extraction / processing requirements
        + Providing basic tools for storing the "core" extracted data in an easily accessible -- from a Data Science perspective -- format
            + Further work may perhaps involve providing tools for easily accessing the data in a more "user friendly" manner
        + Linking the data extracted from various sources
            + by Case
            + by SCOTUS Justices
            + other "indicies"
