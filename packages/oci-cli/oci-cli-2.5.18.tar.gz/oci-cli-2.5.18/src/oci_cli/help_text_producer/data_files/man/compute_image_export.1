.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Exports an image to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Service. You can use the
Object Storage Service URL, or the namespace, bucket name, and object name when specifying the location to export to.
.sp
For more information about exporting images, see \fI\%Image Import/Export\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To perform an image export, you need write access to the Object Storage Service bucket for the image, see \fI\%Let Users Write Objects to Object Storage Buckets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm#Let4\fP>\&.
.sp
See \fI\%Object Storage URLs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#URLs\fP> and [pre\-authenticated requests] for constructing URLs for image import/export.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-image\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the image. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-ns, \-\-namespace [text]
.sp
The Object Storage Service namespace to export the image to. [required]
.SS \-bn, \-\-bucket\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket to export the image to. [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name which will be given to the exported image object. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
