We use this module to temporary store files that need to be integrated to other projects such as Wokkel.

For example, the changeset that introduced this folder adds RSM (XEP-0059) support to Wokkel.
The files in sat.tmp.wokkel are imported over the initial wokkel files from sat.plugins.__init__.py
Proposed changes are currently in review in upstream Wokkel, and this repository may be removed once they are merged upstream.

Wokkel is a project by Ralph Meijer and contributors, it can be fount at https://wokkel.ik.nu/

The Wokkel files in this repository have been updated by Adrien Cossa (souliane) and Jérôme Poisson (goffi), based on the code from Ralph Meijer.
This repository got contributions from Arnaud Joset (jnanar).
