.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN. An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN through that subnet. Each instance has a \fIprimary VNIC\fP that is automatically created and attached during launch. You can add \fIsecondary VNICs\fP to an instance after it\(aqs launched. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Each VNIC has a \fIprimary private IP\fP that is automatically assigned during launch. You can add \fIsecondary private IPs\fP to a VNIC after it\(aqs created. For more information, see \fI\%CreatePrivateIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/CreatePrivateIp\fP> and \fI\%IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Assigns a secondary private IP address to the specified VNIC. The secondary private IP must be in the same subnet as the VNIC.
This command can also be used to move an existing secondary private IP to the specified VNIC.

.SS \-\-vnic\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the VNIC to assign the private IP to. The VNIC and private IP must be in the same subnet. [required]
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP

the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

The value is the hostname portion of the private IP\(aqs fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, \fIbminstance\-1\fP in FQDN \fIbminstance\-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com\fP). Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with \fI\%RFC 952\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952\fP> and \fI\%RFC 1123\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123\fP>\&.
.sp

.sp
Example: \fIbminstance\-1\fP
.SS \-\-ip\-address [text]
.sp
A private IP address of your choice. Must be an available IP address within the subnet\(aqs CIDR. If you don\(aqt specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet.
.sp
Example: \fI10.0.3.3\fP
.SS \-\-unassign\-if\-already\-assigned
.sp
Force reassignment of the IP address if it\(aqs already assigned to another VNIC in the subnet. This is only relevant if an IP address is associated with this command.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
