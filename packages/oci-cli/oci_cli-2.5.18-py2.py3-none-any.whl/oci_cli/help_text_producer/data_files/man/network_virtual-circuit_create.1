.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new virtual circuit to use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see \fI\%FastConnect Overview\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the virtual circuit to reside. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the virtual circuit in the same compartment with the DRG it\(aqs using. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the virtual circuit. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP When creating a virtual circuit, you specify a DRG for the traffic to flow through. Make sure you attach the DRG to your VCN and confirm the VCN\(aqs routing sends traffic to the DRG. Otherwise traffic will not flow. For more information, see \fI\%Route Tables\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment to contain the virtual circuit. [required]
.SS \-\-type [PUBLIC|PRIVATE]
.sp
The type of IP addresses used in this virtual circuit. PRIVATE means \fI\%RFC 1918\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918\fP> addresses (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Only PRIVATE is supported. [required]
.SS \-\-bandwidth\-shape\-name [text]
.sp
The provisioned data rate of the connection.  To get a list of the available bandwidth levels (that is, shapes), see \fI\%ListFastConnectProviderServiceVirtualCircuitBandwidthShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/FastConnectProviderService/ListFastConnectProviderVirtualCircuitBandwidthShapes\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI10 Gbps\fP
.SS \-\-cross\-connect\-mappings [complex type]
.sp
Create a \fICrossConnectMapping\fP for each cross\-connect or cross\-connect group this virtual circuit will run on.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type CrossConnectMapping.  For documentation on CrossConnectMapping please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/CrossConnectMapping\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-customer\-bgp\-asn [integer]
.sp
Your BGP ASN (either public or private). Provide this value only if there\(aqs a BGP session that goes from your edge router to Oracle. Otherwise, leave this empty or null.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-gateway\-id [text]
.sp
For private virtual circuits only. The OCID of the \fI\%dynamic routing gateway (DRG)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Drg\fP> that this virtual circuit uses.
.SS \-\-provider\-name [text]
.sp
Deprecated. Instead use \fIproviderServiceId\fP\&. To get a list of the provider names, see \fI\%ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/FastConnectProviderService/ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-provider\-service\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the service offered by the provider (if you\(aqre connecting via a provider). To get a list of the available service offerings, see \fI\%ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/FastConnectProviderService/ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-provider\-service\-key\-name [text]
.sp
The service key name offered by the provider (if the customer is connecting via a provider).
.SS \-\-provider\-service\-name [text]
.sp
Deprecated. Instead use \fIproviderServiceId\fP\&. To get a list of the provider names, see \fI\%ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/FastConnectProviderService/ListFastConnectProviderServices\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-public\-prefixes [complex type]
.sp
For a public virtual circuit. The public IP prefixes (CIDRs) the customer wants to advertise across the connection.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type CreateVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixDetails.  For documentation on CreateVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixDetails please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/CreateVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixDetails\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-region [text]
.sp
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region where this virtual circuit is located. Example: \fIphx\fP
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PENDING_PROVIDER|VERIFYING|PROVISIONING|PROVISIONED|FAILED|INACTIVE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
