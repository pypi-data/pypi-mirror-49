.SS Description
.sp
Publishes raw metric data points to the Monitoring service. For more information about publishing metrics, see \fI\%Publishing Custom Metrics\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/publishingcustommetrics.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The endpoints for this operation differ from other Monitoring operations. Replace the string \fItelemetry\fP with \fItelemetry\-ingestion\fP in the endpoint, as in the following example:

.SS Options
.SS \-\-metric\-data [complex type]
.sp
A metric object containing raw metric data points to be posted to the Monitoring service.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.SS \-\-batch\-atomicity [ATOMIC|NON_ATOMIC]
.sp
Batch atomicity behavior. Requires either partial or full pass of input validation for metric objects in PostMetricData requests. The default value of NON_ATOMIC requires a partial pass: at least one metric object in the request must pass input validation, and any objects that failed validation are identified in the returned summary, along with their error messages. A value of ATOMIC requires a full pass: all metric objects in the request must pass input validation.
.sp
Example: \fINON_ATOMIC\fP
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS \-\-resolution [text]
.sp
The time between calculated aggregation windows. Use with the query interval to vary the frequency at which aggregated data points are returned. For example, use a query interval of 5 minutes with a resolution of 1 minute to retrieve five\-minute aggregations at a one\-minute frequency. The resolution must be equal or less than the interval in the query. The default resolution is 1m (one minute). Supported values: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP).
.sp
Example: \fI5m\fP
.SS \-\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.sp
When true, returns resources from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy\-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment specified in compartmentId. Default is false.
.SS \-\-query\-text [text]
.sp
The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to use when searching for metric data points to aggregate. The query must specify a metric, statistic, and interval. Supported values for interval: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: \fIgrouping()\fP, \fIgroupBy()\fP\&. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see \fI\%Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm\fP>\&. For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See \fI\%Supported Services\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fICpuUtilization[1m].sum()\fP [required]
