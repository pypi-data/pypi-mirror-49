## Installin'

Installing is EZPZ...

    pip install pupy

If you plan on using Jason you can install `ujson` for a speed boost *(if you wanna go fast; pupy uses the python-stdlib json if you wanna go slow)*...

    pip install ujson 

But wait theres more! Pupy has several optional dependencies for savings and loads which you can install with...
    
    pip install ruamel.yaml  # If ya mel in your spare time
    pip install msgpack  # If you wanna pack messages
    pip install toml  # toml (aka 'that other markup language'(?))
    pip install aiofiles  # if you wanna do async stuff
