class PotentialPair:
    # TODO pseudocode
    #   This serves mostly (only?) to compare one potentially pairing with another.
    #   Comparisons are based on:
    #   Ties are broken in the following order (starting with the first):
    #       1 - Mentor preferences (site, gender). A mentee who has more "yes"es break the tie.
    #       2 - Level difference: A smaller level difference wins.
    #       3 - Rank Order: Whichever mentee ranked this mentor higher wins.
    #       4 - Count of preferred wwids: The mentee who listed more preferred wwids wins.
    #       5 - History - the mentee who's been rejected the most or had the least number of mentors wins
    #       6 - Priority - mentees who were rejected last year fall into this category.
    #               These are the ones we want badly to match up this year.
    #               This one has the potential to move up the tiebreaker order.
    #               If, for example, we arrive at the end and there are 'priority' mentees
    #       7 - First applied - probably will only rarely come up, but there needs to be some final tie breaker...
    #   There are other factors I brainstormed, but they won't be used during the preferred matching phase.
    #       Random vs. Preferred Pairing -- not used in preferred matching
    #       Does the Mentee want a random pairing at all? -- not used in preferred matching
    #       Mentee preferences (site, gender)  -- not used in preferred matching
    pass
