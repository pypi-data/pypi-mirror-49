.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-zone\-name\-or\-id [text]
.sp
The name or OCID of the target zone. [required]
.SS \-\-domain [text]
.sp
The target fully\-qualified domain name (FQDN) within the target zone. [required]
.SS \-\-rtype [text]
.sp
The type of the target RRSet within the target zone. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-none\-match [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-None\-Match\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the absence of any current representation of the target resource, when the field\-value is \fI*\fP, or having a selected representation with an entity\-tag that does not match any of those listed in the field\-value.
.SS \-\-if\-modified\-since [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-Modified\-Since\fP header field makes a GET or HEAD request method conditional on the selected representation\(aqs modification date being more recent than the date provided in the field\-value.  Transfer of the selected representation\(aqs data is avoided if that data has not changed.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of items to return in a page of the collection.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous "List" call.
.SS \-\-zone\-version [text]
.sp
The version of the zone for which data is requested.
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment the resource belongs to.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
