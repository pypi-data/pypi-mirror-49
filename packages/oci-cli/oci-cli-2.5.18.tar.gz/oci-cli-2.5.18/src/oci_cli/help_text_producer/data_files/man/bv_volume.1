.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A detachable block volume device that allows you to dynamically expand the storage capacity of an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of Cloud Volume Storage\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new volume in the specified compartment. Volumes can be created in sizes ranging from 50 GB (51200 MB) to 16 TB (16777216 MB), in 1 GB (1024 MB) increments. By default, volumes are 1 TB (1048576 MB). For general information about block volumes, see \fI\%Overview of Block Volume Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
A volume and instance can be in separate compartments but must be in the same Availability Domain. For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about Availability Domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the volume, which is simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
