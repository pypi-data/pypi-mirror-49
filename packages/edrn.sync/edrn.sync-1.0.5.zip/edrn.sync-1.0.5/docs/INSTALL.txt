Installation
************

This document tells you how to install edrn.sync.


Quick Instructions
==================

Run::

    pip install edrn.sync

What?  You don't have pip_?  You're seriously still using easy_install_?
Sigh::

    easy_install edrn.sync

That's it.  (Of course, you might want to put it into a buildout_ or a
virtualenv_).


Full Instructions
=================

edrn.sync requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4
or later.  As of this writing, 2.7 is the latest stable version.  If Python is
not yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source
distributions from the Python website.

To test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::

    python -V
    
You should see output similar to::

    Python 2.7
    
indicating the version of Python installed.  edrn.sync also requires `Agile
OODT`_.  OODT_ is Object Oriented Data Technology, a framework for metadata
and data grids.  Agile OODT is a Python version of OODT that supports higher
performance and easier integration than the Java_ version.

By far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install edrn.sync is
to use pip_.  If your Python installation has pip available to it (and *all*
virtualenvs do), then this one command is all you need to run in order to
download, build, install, and generate command-line tools all in one go::

    pip install edrn.sync
    
That will also download and install all dependencies, including Agile OODT.  


Executables
-----------

The commands ``dmccsync`` and ``dmccgroupsync`` will be generated and placed
with your standard installation directory for Python commands.  Usually, this
is the same location as the ``python`` executable itself.
