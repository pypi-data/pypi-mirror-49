.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the policy. [required]
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the policy. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable.
.SS \-\-statements [text]
.sp
A JSON array of policy statements written in the policy language. See \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP> and \fI\%Common Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm\fP>\&. Example: \(aq["statement 1","statement 2"]\(aq (The single quotes are required.)
.SS \-\-version\-date [text]
.sp
The version of the policy. If set to an empty string, when a request comes in for authorization, the policy will be evaluated according to the current behavior of the services at that moment. If set to a particular date (YYYY\-MM\-DD), the policy will be evaluated according to the behavior of the services on that date.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Simple key\-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross\-compatibility only. Example: \fI{"bar\-key": "value"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: \fI{"foo\-namespace": {"bar\-key": "foo\-value"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
