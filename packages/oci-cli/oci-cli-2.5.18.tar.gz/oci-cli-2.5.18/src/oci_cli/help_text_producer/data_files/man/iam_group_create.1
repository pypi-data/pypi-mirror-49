.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new group in your tenancy.
.sp
You must specify your tenancy\(aqs OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the group, which must be unique across all groups in your tenancy and cannot be changed. You can use this name or the OCID when writing policies that apply to the group. For more information about policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the group (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Group/UpdateGroup\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
After creating the group, you need to put users in it and write policies for it. See \fI\%AddUserToGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup\fP> and \fI\%CreatePolicy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Policy/CreatePolicy\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the tenancy containing the group. If not provided, this parameter will use the tenancy from the config file.
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name you assign to the group during creation. The name must be unique across all groups in the tenancy and cannot be changed. [required]
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the group during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. [required]
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|INACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
