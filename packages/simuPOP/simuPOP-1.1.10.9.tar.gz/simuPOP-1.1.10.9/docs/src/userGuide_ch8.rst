A real world example
********************

Previous chapters use a lot of examples to demonstrate individual simuPOP
features. However, it might not be clear how to integrate these features in
longer scripts that address real world problems, which may involve larger
populations, more complex genetic and demographic models and may run thousands
of replicates with different parameters. This chapter will show you, step by
step, how to write a complete simuPOP script that has been used in a real-world
research topic.
