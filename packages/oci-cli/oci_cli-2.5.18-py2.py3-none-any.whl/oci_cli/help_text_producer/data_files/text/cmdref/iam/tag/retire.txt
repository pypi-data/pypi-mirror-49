retire
******


Description
===========

Retires a tag so that it cannot be used to tag resources. Retiring a
tag will also retire the related rules. You can not create a tag with
the same name as a retired tag. Tags must be unique within their tag
namespace but can be repeated across namespaces. You cannot add a tag
with the same name as a retired tag in the same tag namespace.


Usage
=====

   oci iam tag retire [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--tag-namespace-id [text]
-------------------------

The OCID of the tag namespace. [required]


--tag-name [text]
-----------------

The name of the tag. [required]


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
