The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new volume group in the specified compartment. A volume group is a collection of volumes and may be created from a list of volumes, cloning an existing volume group, or by restoring a volume group backup. A volume group can contain up to 64 volumes. You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the volume group, which is simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
