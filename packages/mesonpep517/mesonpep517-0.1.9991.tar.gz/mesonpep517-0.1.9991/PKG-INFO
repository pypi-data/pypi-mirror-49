Description: OpenTimelineIO is an interchange format and API for
        editorial cut information. OTIO is not a container format for media, rather it
        contains information about the order and length of cuts and references to
        external media.
        
        OTIO includes both a file format and an API for manipulating that format. It
        also includes a plugin architecture for writing adapters to convert from/to
        existing editorial timeline formats. It also implements a dependency- less
        library for dealing strictly with time, opentime.
        
        You can provide adapters for your video editing tool or pipeline as needed.
        Each adapter allows for import/export between that proprietary tool and the
        OpenTimelineIO format.
