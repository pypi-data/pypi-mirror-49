class SelfingGenoTransmitter
----------------------------

.. class:: SelfingGenoTransmitter

   A genotype transmitter (during-mating operator) that transmits
   parental genotype of a parent through self-fertilization. That is
   to say, the offspring genotype is formed according to Mendel's
   laws, only that a parent serves as both maternal and paternal
   parents.


   .. method:: SelfingGenoTransmitter(output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a self-fertilization genotype transmitter that transmits
      genotypes of a parent to an offspring through self-
      fertilization. Cutsomized chromosomes are not handled.
      Parameters *subPops* and *infoFields* are ignored. This operator
      also copies allelic lineage when it is executed in a module with
      lineage allele type.
