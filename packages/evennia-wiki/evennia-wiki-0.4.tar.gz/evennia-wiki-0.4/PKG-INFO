Description: # evennia-wiki
        
        A simple wiki for `Evennia`, simple to install within an [Evennia](www.evennia.com) game.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You have to install Evennia beforehand.  Once done, to add the Wiki, install from pypi:
        
            pip install evennia_wiki
        
        Then, in your Evennia folder, edit `server/conf/settings.py` to add
        the installed app:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS += (
                # ...
                "evennia_wiki",
        )
        ```
        
        Finally, in `web/urls.py`, you should add the custom URL:
        
        ```python
        custom_patterns = [
            # ...
            url(r'^wiki/', include('evennia_wiki.urls', namespace='wiki')),
        ]
        ```
        
        Donâ€™t forget to run `evennia migrate` after that.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can now run your game:
        
            evennia start
        
        Go to your website: http://localhost:4001/wiki/ .
        
        ## Settings
        
        By default, the wiki is off-limit to players.  Only authenticated builders have access to it, to write it and read it.  You can change these defaults.
        
        The current possibility is to change this default for every page.  It is not possible to do it for a specific page.  Go to your `settings.lpy` file and change one of these settings:
        
        - `WIKI_CAN_READ`: who can read the wiki? Set to `"builder"` by default. Change it to `"anonymous"` to allow anonymous visitors to read your wiki (but not edit it).
        - `WIKI_CAN_WRITE`: who can write your wiki?  Set to `"builder"` by default.  For the time being, anonymous users cannot edit a wiki page, so you need to set it to a group of authenticated users (like `"builder"`  or `"admin"`).
