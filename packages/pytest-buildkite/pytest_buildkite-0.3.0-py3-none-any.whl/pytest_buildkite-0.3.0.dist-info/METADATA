Note: This library was repurposed from tonybaloney's pytest-azurepipelines,
the repurposing process is not yet complete.

Plugin for `pytest`_ that automatically publishes coverage and pytest report
`annotations`_ to BuildKite.

Just run pytest with this plugin and see your test results in the BuildKite UI!

----

Features:

* Formats the PyTest output to show test docstrings and module names instead of just test case names in the Buildkite UI.
* Overloads the `--junit-xml` flag on execution with a default value
* Uploads test results automatically, no need for a seperate test results upload command
* Displays the number of failed tests if there were failures as an error message in the UI
* Automatically formats code coverage and uploads coverage data if pytest-cov is installed


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-buildkite" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-buildkite

Running in Docker
-----------------

The plugin attempts to automatically detect if running inside a docker
container with path mounted in a different location, it will apply
the mappings to the path to report them back to Azure Pipelines using the path
from the host that has been bind mounted to the docker container. No
configuration is required it should just work as long as bind mounting is
used to the path the pytest output is written to. Also ensure the files are
written using an account the host has access to, this can be done by supplying
the user and group of the host account to the run command.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" ...
