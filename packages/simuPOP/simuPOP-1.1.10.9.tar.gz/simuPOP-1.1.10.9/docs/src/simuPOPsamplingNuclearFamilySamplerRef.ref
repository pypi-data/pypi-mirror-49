class NuclearFamilySampler
--------------------------

.. class:: NuclearFamilySampler

   A sampler that draws nuclear families with specified number of affected
   parents and offspring.

   .. method:: NuclearFamilySampler.NuclearFamilySampler(families, numOffspring, affectedParents=0, affectedOffspring=0, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, idField='ind_id', fatherField='father_id', motherField='mother_id')

      Creates a nuclear family sampler with parameters
      
      families
          number of families. This can be a number or a list of numbers. In the latter
          case, specified families are drawn from each subpopulation.
      
      numOffspring
          number of offspring. This can be a fixed number or a range [min, max].
      
      affectedParents
          number of affected parents. This can be a fixed number or a range [min, max].
      
      affectedOffspring
          number of affected offspring. This can be a fixed number of a range [min, max].
      
      subPops
          A list of (virtual) subpopulations from which samples are drawn.
          The default value is ALL_AVAIL, which means all available
          subpopulations of a population.

   .. method:: NuclearFamilySampler.drawSample(input_pop)

      Randomly select Pedigrees

   .. method:: NuclearFamilySampler.drawSamples(pop, numOfSamples)

      Draw multiple samples and return a list of populations.

   .. method:: NuclearFamilySampler.family(id)

      Return id, its spouse and their children

   .. method:: NuclearFamilySampler.prepareSample(input_pop)

      Prepare self.pedigree, some pedigree sampler might need additional loci and
      information fields for this sampler.
