"""A peer review plugin which attempts to assign pairwise peer reviews.
Intended for students to sit and discuss their code bases with each other, as
well as leave feedback. More specifically, N students are split into N/2
groups, each group member assigned to peer review the other person in the
group.

If N is odd, the students are split into (N-1)/2 groups, in which one group has
3 members.
