        Reference implementation of SLIP-0039: Shamir's Secret-Sharing for Mnemonic
        Codes
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        This SLIP describes a standard and interoperable implementation of Shamir's
        secret sharing (SSS). SSS splits a secret into unique parts which can be
        distributed among participants, and requires a specified minimum number of
        parts to be supplied in order to reconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of
        fewer than the required number of parts does not leak information about the
        secret.
        
        Specification
        -------------
        
        See https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md for full
        specification.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        With pip from GitHub:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip3 install https://github.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic
        
        From local checkout for development:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python3 setup.py develop
        
        CLI usage
        ---------
        
        CLI tool is included as a reference and UX testbed. It is **very obviously insecure**.
        DO NOT USE it for generating or decoding any sort of serious secrets.
        
        When the :code:`shamir_mnemonic` package is installed, you can use the :code:`shamir` command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ shamir create 3of5   # create a 3-of-5 set of shares
        
        Use :code:`shamir --help` or :code:`shamir <command> --help` to get detailed help.
        
        If you want to run the CLI from a local checkout without installing, use the following
        command:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python3 -m shamir_mnemonic.cli
        
        Test vectors
        ------------
        
        The test vectors in vectors.json are given as a list of triples. The first member of the
        triple is a description of the test vector, the second member is a list of mnemonics and
        the third member is the master secret which results from combining the mnemonics. The
        master secret is encoded as a string containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte. If
        the string is empty, then attempting to combine the given set of mnemonics should result
        in error. The passphrase "TREZOR" is used for all valid sets of mnemonics.
