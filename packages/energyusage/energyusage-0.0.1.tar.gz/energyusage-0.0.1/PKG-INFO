Description: # energyusage
        
        A Python package that measures the environmental impact of computation. Provides a function to
        evaluate the energy usage and related carbon emissions of another function.
        Emissions are calculated based on the user's location via the GeoJS API and that location's
        energy mix data (sources: US E.I.A and eGRID for the year 2016).
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install, simply `pip install energyusage`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To evaluate the emissions of a function, just call `energyusage.evaluate` with the function
        name and the arguments it requires. 
        
        ```python
        import energyusage
        
        # User defined function to be evaluated
        def power(base, exp):
          return base**exp
        
        energyusage.evaluate(power,10,10)
        ```
        
        ## Notes
        
        Due to the methods in which the energy measurement is being done (through the Intel RAPL
        interface and NVIDIA-smi), our package is only available on Linux kernels that have the
        RAPL interface and/or machines with an Nvidia GPU.
