        * Make sure python is in system path.
        
        # Installation
        1.  **Set up database drivers (only required on macOS).**<br>
        	 install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/); a package manager for macOS.<br>
        	 ODBC driver provides the connection to the Opedia database.
        
        	```
        	$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        	$ brew install unixodbc freetds ffmpeg
