        Installation notes:
        
        This package requires scipy, which in turn  requires blas, lapack, atlas, and
        gfortran. These can be installed on a Ubuntu system with:
        
            sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
        
        Examples:
        
        See examples folder for a jupyter notebook with example usage.
        
        NOTE:
        
        The cases when the chosen model (in the language of MacKinnon 1996) is 1\* or 2\* have not yet been fully implemented. They will be completed in the near future.
