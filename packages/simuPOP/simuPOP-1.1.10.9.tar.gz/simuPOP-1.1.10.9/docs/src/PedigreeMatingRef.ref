class PedigreeMating
--------------------

.. class:: PedigreeMating

   This mating scheme evolves a population following an existing
   pedigree structure. If the :class:`Pedigree` object has ``N``
   ancestral generations and a present generation, it can be used to
   evolve a population for ``N`` generations, starting from the
   topmost ancestral generation. At the *k-th* generation, this mating
   scheme produces an offspring generation according to subpopulation
   structure of the ``N-k-1`` ancestral generation in the pedigree
   object (e.g. producing the offspring population of generation 0
   according to the ``N-1`` ancestral generation of the pedigree
   object ). For each offspring, this mating scheme copies individual
   ID and sex from the corresponing individual in the pedigree object.
   It then locates the parents of each offspring using their IDs in
   the pedigree object. A list of during mating operators are then
   used to transmit parental genotype to the offspring. The population
   being evolved must have an information field ``'ind_id'``.


   .. method:: PedigreeMating(ped, ops, idField="ind_id")


      Creates a pedigree mating scheme that evolves a population
      according to :class:`Pedigree` object *ped*. The evolved
      population should contain individuals with ID (at information
      field *idField*, default to ``'ind_id'``) that match those
      individual in the topmost ancestral generation who have
      offspring. After parents of each individuals are determined from
      their IDs, a list of during-mating operators *ops* are applied
      to transmit genotypes. The return value of these operators are
      not checked.
