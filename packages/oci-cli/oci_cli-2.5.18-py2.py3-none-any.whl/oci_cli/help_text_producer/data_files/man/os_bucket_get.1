.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-bucket\-name, \-\-name, \-bn [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: \fImy\-new\-bucket1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to match. For creating and committing a multipart upload to an object, this is the entity tag of the target object. For uploading a part, this is the entity tag of the target part.
.SS \-\-if\-none\-match [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to avoid matching. The only valid value is \(aq*\(aq, which indicates that the request should fail if the object already exists. For creating and committing a multipart upload, this is the entity tag of the target object. For uploading a part, this is the entity tag of the target part.
.SS \-\-fields [approximateCount|approximateSize]
.sp
Bucket summary includes the \(aqnamespace\(aq, \(aqname\(aq, \(aqcompartmentId\(aq, \(aqcreatedBy\(aq, \(aqtimeCreated\(aq, and \(aqetag\(aq fields. This parameter can also include \(aqapproximateCount\(aq (approximate number of objects) and \(aqapproximateSize\(aq (total approximate size in bytes of all objects). For example \(aqapproximateCount,approximateSize\(aq.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
