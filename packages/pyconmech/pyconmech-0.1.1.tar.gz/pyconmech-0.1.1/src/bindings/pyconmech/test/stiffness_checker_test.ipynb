    "\n",
    "Elastic structure deforms under load, and by deforming themselves they develop resistance (or reaction) force to balance the external load.\n",

    "So in a nutshell, the stiffness checker calculates elastic deformation and corresponding reaction force of a frame structure under given load. We mainly consider the gravity load induced by elements' self-weight in construction sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the solver tries to piece many elements' unit behavior together to reach equilibrium with the external force. Each element obeys both Hooke's law and the [Beam equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Bernoulli_beam_theory), which tells us how does an element **develops internal force** to balance external load via **deformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So locally in **each beam's own local coordinate system**, we have the local elastic equation:\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} F^{e-n1}_{L} \\\\ --- \\\\ F^{e-n2}_{L} \\end{pmatrix} := \\begin{pmatrix}F^{n1}_{Lx}\\\\ F^{n1}_{Ly} \\\\ F^{n1}_{Lz} \\\\ M^{n1}_{Lx} \\\\ M^{n1}_{Ly} \\\\ M^{n1}_{Lz} \\\\ --- \\\\ F^{n2}_{Lx}\\\\ F^{n2}_{Ly} \\\\ F^{n2}_{Lz} \\\\ M^{n2}_{Lx} \\\\ M^{n2}_{Ly} \\\\ M^{n2}_{Lz}\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{K_e} \\begin{pmatrix} d^{n1}_{Lx}\\\\ d^{n1}_{Ly} \\\\ d^{n1}_{Lz} \\\\ \\theta^{n1}_{Lx} \\\\ \\theta^{n1}_{Ly} \\\\ \\theta^{n1}_{Lz} \\\\ --- \\\\ d^{n2}_{Lx}\\\\ d^{n2}_{Ly} \\\\ d^{n2}_{Lz} \\\\ \\theta^{n2}_{Lx} \\\\ \\theta^{n2}_{Ly} \\\\ \\theta^{n2}_{Lz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{K_e} \\begin{pmatrix} u^{e-n1}_{L} \\\\ --- \\\\ u^{e-n2}_{L} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

Finally, we assembly these nodal equations together into a giant linear system and we solve."

    "## The relationship between `fixities_reaction` and `element_reaction`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with fully constrained elastic frame structures (all the frame nodes and fixities are 6-dof fixed), a partially assembled structure will never collapse because of mechanism, as long as it does not have unconnected, floating elements. Or in other words, reaction force will be in equilibrium at each node (no matter they are grounded or not).\n",

    "### For nodes that are not fixities\n",

    "For nodes that are not fixities, the forces are from connected elements' internal reaction force and loads. So the force equilibrium at this node $v$ is:\n",

    "Where $R_{e, GL}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ global to local rotation matrix of element $e$. The element internal reaction $\\begin{pmatrix}F^{v}_{e, Lx}, F^{v}_{e, Ly}, F^{v}_{e, Lz}, M^{v}_{e, Lx}, M^{v}_{e, Lx}, M^{v}_{e, Lz} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the entries that we get from element $e$'s corresponding row in `element_reaction`. This vector is descirbed in local coordinate of element $e$, and that's why we need to use the rotation matrix $R_{e, GL}$ to transform it back to global coordinate, so that we can have all the element's reaction force described in the same system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that each row of `element_reaction` contains two such 6 dimensional vectors, corresponding to two end point of element $e$. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The force $F_{v, \\textrm{e self-w load}}$ is the lumped self-weight of the element $e$ described in the global coordinate. We will talk about this formation of this self-weight load in more detail in the next section. \n",

    "The summation over all the connected element $e \\in \\{e | e \\sim v\\}$ means that both the number of internal force and the self-weight load will be changing when we are considering different partially assembled structures. Indeed, within the implementation of `stiffness_checker`, we pre-calculate all the [element-wise stiffness matrix](https://github.com/yijiangh/conmech/blob/224b24b07688af61033994a23f24fb9bb0e7c2d0/src/stiffness_checker/Stiffness.cpp#L246) and [self-weight load](https://github.com/yijiangh/conmech/blob/224b24b07688af61033994a23f24fb9bb0e7c2d0/src/stiffness_checker/Stiffness.cpp#L363), both of which are in global coordinate. Whenever we feed the checker with a set of exisiting element ids, we simply assembly corresponding element's stiffness matrix and load vector together to form a structure-wise linear system and solve it. By doing this, we are not doing repetitive calculation.\n",

    "The main load case of construction sequencing is self-weight, i.e. the gravity force that acts *along the span of the frame element*, which is a distributed load. One common idea in Finite Element Analysis (FEM) is to \"lump\" these distributed load to its boundary. In our context, the boundary of our elements is two end points, so we calculate the equivalent point load acting at the element end points.\n",

    "And for skewed elements, where the local x axis is not aligned with the global z axis (- gravity direction), we can decompose the gravity force to components that are perpendicular to the local x axis $P_{\\perp x}$ amd $P_{// x}$. The $P_{// x}$ can be simply treated as load along the local x axis, and $P_{\\perp x}$ can be lumped into end point loads using the fixed-end uniformly loaded beam formula above.\n",
