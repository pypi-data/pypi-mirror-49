Plotting data contained in one or more lists

Here, we explain how to plot data which has been calculated before and which is
available in a list. ...

The procedure is quite the same as for plotting a data file or a function in
the above examples. It differs in that we use an instance of
`graph.data.values` or `graph.data.points` in the `plot` method of the graph.
The choice of one or the other variant depends on convenience and how the data
has been generated: In `graph.data.values` the coordinate values are provided
as individual lists. Alternatively, `graph.data.points` takes a list of data
points which come as coordinate tuples. You will then have to say something
like `x=1, y=2` to specify which entry in your tuples is to be used on which
axis.

Similarly to the plotting of a data file, the default plotting style here are
symbols.

Caution: This feature has been renamed/introduced between versions 0.9 and
0.10. In versions 0.9 and before the functionality of `graph.data.points` was
provided by `graph.data.list`.
