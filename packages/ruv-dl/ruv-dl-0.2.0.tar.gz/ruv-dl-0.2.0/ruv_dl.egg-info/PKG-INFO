Description: Sync available ruv programs to your computer
        
        # Installation
        
        `pip install ruv-dl`
        
        # Usage
        
        See `ruv-dl --help`
        
        # Crontab
        
        Ruv-dl works best when it's being run periodically in cron. Start by running
        it manually and start downloading some programs, e.g.
        `ruv-dl download Hvolpasveitin`. Now that program is considered to be synced.
        After that you can run `ruv-dl download -u` and it will attempt to download
        new episodes in previously synced programs.
        
        # Uploading a new version
        
        1. Set a new version in setup.py
        2. Run `. ./prepare_upload.sh` (this is assuming you have lastpass.
            Optional if you want to type your pypi credentials manually).
        3. Run `make upload`
