Description: pyphash is a Python extension module that wraps the C library function
        `crypt`, which performs passphrase hashing, in the simplest possible
        fashion.  It exposes one function, named `crypt`, which works just
        like the C `crypt` except that it is thread safe:
        
        
            >>> pyphash.crypt("swordfish", "$5e$z4x3Zlhs")
            '$5$z4x3Zlhs$g7JP4M7HZw5L25Xwklbd2nQ2rfjzVGFB1SJutFnmvK4'
        
        You have to create settings strings yourself.
        
        This module is not intended to be used by programs that actually need
        to hash passphrasesâ€”if it were, it would at least also provide access
        to `crypt_gensalt`.  Rather, its purpose is to be a test case for the
        packaging toolchain for C extension modules.  Linux distributions are
        changing how they provide the shared library that implements `crypt`,
        and Python packaging must adapt.  See [manylinux bug
        #305](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/305) for the gory details.
        
        For thread safety, the module actually uses the reentrant variant of
        `crypt` called `crypt_r`, and looks for it in `crypt.h` rather than
        `unistd.h`.  It will fail to compile if this function or this header
        is not available.
