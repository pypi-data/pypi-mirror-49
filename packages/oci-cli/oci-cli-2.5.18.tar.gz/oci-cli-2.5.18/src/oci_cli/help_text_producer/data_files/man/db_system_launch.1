.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Launches a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability domain. The Oracle Database edition that you specify applies to all the databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be changed.
.sp
An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request parameters you provide and some default options. For more information, see \fI\%Default Options for the Initial Database\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Tasks/launchingDB.htm#DefaultOptionsfortheInitialDatabase\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment the DB system  belongs in. [required]
.SS \-\-availability\-domain [text]
.sp
The availability domain where the DB system is located. [required]
.SS \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the subnet the DB system is associated with.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. \- For Exadata and virtual machine 2\-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]
.sp
The shape of the DB system. The shape determines resources allocated to the DB system. \- For virtual machine shapes, the number of CPU cores and memory \- For bare metal and Exadata shapes, the number of CPU cores, memory, and storage
.sp
To get a list of shapes, use the \fI\%ListDbSystemShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/database/20160918/DbSystemShapeSummary/ListDbSystemShapes\fP> operation. [required]
.SS \-\-hostname [text]
.sp
The hostname for the DB system. The hostname must begin with an alphabetic character, and can contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens (\-). The maximum length of the hostname is 16 characters for bare metal and virtual machine DB systems, and 12 characters for Exadata DB systems.
.sp
The maximum length of the combined hostname and domain is 63 characters.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The hostname must be unique within the subnet. If it is not unique, the DB system will fail to provision. [required]
.SS \-\-cpu\-core\-count [integer]
.sp
The number of CPU cores to enable for a bare metal or Exadata DB system. The valid values depend on the specified shape:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
BM.DenseIO1.36 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 36. \- BM.DenseIO2.52 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 52. \- Exadata.Quarter1.84 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 22 to 84. \- Exadata.Half1.168 \- Specify a multiple of 4, from 44 to 168. \- Exadata.Full1.336 \- Specify a multiple of 8, from 88 to 336. \- Exadata.Quarter2.92 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 0 to 92. \- Exadata.Half2.184 \- Specify a multiple of 4, from 0 to 184. \- Exadata.Full2.368 \- Specify a multiple of 8, from 0 to 368.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This parameter is not used for virtual machine DB systems because virtual machine DB systems have a set number of cores for each shape. For information about the number of cores for a virtual machine DB system shape, see \fI\%Virtual Machine DB Systems\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/overview.htm#virtualmachine\fP> [required]
.SS \-\-database\-edition [STANDARD_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_HIGH_PERFORMANCE|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE]
.sp
The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the DB system. Exadata DB systems and 2\-node RAC DB systems require ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE. [required]
.SS \-\-fault\-domains [complex type]
.sp
A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Fault Domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the Fault Domain, the system selects one for you. To change the Fault Domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred Fault Domain.
.sp
If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which Fault Domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the Fault Domains you specify so that no Fault Domain contains more than one node.
.sp
To get a list of Fault Domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
