class AdmixtureEvent
--------------------

.. class:: AdmixtureEvent

   This event implements a population admixture event that mix
   individuals from specified subpopulations to either a new 
   subpopulation or an existing subpopulation.

   .. method:: AdmixtureEvent.AdmixtureEvent(sizes=[], toSubPop=None, name='', ops=[], output='', begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=True, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])

      Create an admixed population by choosing individuals
      from all or specified subpopulations (``subPops``) and creating
      an admixed population ``toSubPop``. The admixed population will
      be appended to the population as a new subpopulation with name
      ``name`` if ``toSubPop`` is ``None`` (default), or replace an
      existing subpopulation with name or index ``toSubPop``. The admixed
      population consists of individuals from ``subPops`` according to
      specified ``sizes``. Its size is maximized to have the largest
      number of individuals from the source population when a new population
      is created, or equal to the size of the existing destination population.
      The parameter ``sizes`` should be a list of float numbers 
      between 0 and 1, and add up to 1 (e.g. ``[0.4, 0.4, 0.2]``, although
      this function ignores the last element and set it to 1 minus the 
      sum of the other numbers). Alternatively, parameter ``sizes`` can
      be a list of numbers used to explicitly specify the size of admixed
      population and number of individuals from each source subpopulation.
      In all cases, the size of source populations will be kept constant.
