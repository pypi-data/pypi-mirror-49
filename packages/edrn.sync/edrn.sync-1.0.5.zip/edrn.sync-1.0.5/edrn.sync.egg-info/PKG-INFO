        EDRN Sync provides an API for slurping up DMCC RDF representing
        EDRN users and groups and registering those users into our EDRN 
        IC LDAP server.
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        This document tells you how to install edrn.sync.
        
        
        Quick Instructions
        ==================
        
        Run::
        
            pip install edrn.sync
        
        What?  You don't have pip_?  You're seriously still using easy_install_?
        Sigh::
        
            easy_install edrn.sync
        
        That's it.  (Of course, you might want to put it into a buildout_ or a
        virtualenv_).
        
        
        Full Instructions
        =================
        
        edrn.sync requires the Python_ programming language.  We recommend version 2.4
        or later.  As of this writing, 2.7 is the latest stable version.  If Python is
        not yet installed on your system, you can find binary and and source
        distributions from the Python website.
        
        To test if a correct version of Python is available on your system, run::
        
            python -V
            
        You should see output similar to::
        
            Python 2.7
            
        indicating the version of Python installed.  edrn.sync also requires `Agile
        OODT`_.  OODT_ is Object Oriented Data Technology, a framework for metadata
        and data grids.  Agile OODT is a Python version of OODT that supports higher
        performance and easier integration than the Java_ version.
        
        By far the easiest, recommended, and encouraged way to install edrn.sync is
        to use pip_.  If your Python installation has pip available to it (and *all*
        virtualenvs do), then this one command is all you need to run in order to
        download, build, install, and generate command-line tools all in one go::
        
            pip install edrn.sync
            
        That will also download and install all dependencies, including Agile OODT.  
        
        
        Executables
        -----------
        
        The commands ``dmccsync`` and ``dmccgroupsync`` will be generated and placed
        with your standard installation directory for Python commands.  Usually, this
        is the same location as the ``python`` executable itself.

        Using EDRN Sync Services
        ************************
        
        Installing the EDRN Sync Services package makes available the following
        commands on your computer:
        
        ``dmccsync`` command
            The ``dmccsync`` command lets you slurp up a DMCC RDF file containing users
            that need to be entered into EDRN IC LDAP.
        ``dmccgroupsync`` command
            Takes a DMCC RDF users file and a sites file and imports the associated
            PI groups and collaborative groups into the EDRN IC LDAPS server.
        ``secureoldpasswords`` command
            Goes through all existing LDAP users and tests if they're using the old,
            insecure default password and changes those passwords to something
            randomized.

        new users and also provides a utility for detecting old weak passwords and
        changing them to something randomized.
