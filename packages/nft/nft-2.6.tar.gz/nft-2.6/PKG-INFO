        Installing
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install nft
        
        
        Running
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Just like that, we should be in business. NFT works something like the touch command but instead of creating empty files, nft creates
        boilerplate files from the template. The first time you run nft, it will ask a few questions to better fill out the template. Try it out with something
        like:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft test.java
        
        Which created the following file:
        
        ::
        
            /*-------------------------------------

        Other File Types
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        NFT can make the following kinds of source files:
        
        - C files and headers
        - Java
        - Python
        - Ruby
        - Shell (bash and Csh)
        
        NFT can also build non-source files. The standard README types are included:
        
        - README (txt)
        - README.md (markdown)
        - README.rst (restructured text)
        
        Any of these can be run as follows:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft README.md
        
        NOTE
        ~~~~
        If you want to reenter your name or email or recompile the list of templates (if you added a new template) use:
        
        ::
        
            $ nft setup
