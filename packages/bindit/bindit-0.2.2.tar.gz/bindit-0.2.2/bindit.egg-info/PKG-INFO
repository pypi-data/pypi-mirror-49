        Takes the drudgery out of binding volumes on Docker and (soon) Singularity
        
        bindit is a wrapper for container runners that makes it easy to handle file input and
        output for containerised command-line applications. It works by detecting file paths in
        the container image arguments, and rebasing these as necessary onto new bind mounts. See
        `docs`_ for full detail, but here is the high-level API:

             bindit is a wrapper for container runners that makes it easy to handle
             file input and output for containerized command-line applications. It
             works by detecting file paths in the container image arguments, and
             rebasing these as necessary onto new bind mounts.
        
           Options:
             -i, --ignorepath PATH  path(s) on the host to ignore when detecting new bind
                                    mounts. Typical         linux binary locations
                                    (/usr/bin etc) are included on this list by default.
             -a, --absonly          Only rebase absolute paths.
             -d, --dryrun           Return formatted shell command without invoking
                                    container runner
             -l, --loglevel TEXT    Logging level  [default: INFO]
             --help                 Show this message and exit.
        
           Commands:
             docker
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           Usage: bindit_partial [OPTIONS] SCRIPT_ARG...
        
             bindit_partial constructs a shell script wrapper for bindit (or your
             container runner directly) that can be used as a command line interface
             for the container. It works a bit like functools.partial in the standard
             library - you can offload some default parameters (e.g. for volume binds
             mounts) to the script in order to obtain a cleaner API for the container.
        
             For main documentation, see bindit.
        
           Options:
             --output_file TEXT     Output to file instead of standard out
             --shebang TEXT         Shell interpreter directive  [default: #!/bin/bash]
             --vararg_pattern TEXT  vararg pattern (try "$argv" for csh/tcsh)  [default:
                                    "$@"]
             --help                 Show this message and exit.   Usage: bindit_partial [OPTIONS] SCRIPT_ARG...
