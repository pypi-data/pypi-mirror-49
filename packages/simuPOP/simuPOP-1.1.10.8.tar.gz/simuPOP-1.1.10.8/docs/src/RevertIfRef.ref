.. class:: RevertIf

   This operator replaces the current evolving population by a
   population loaded from a specified filename if certain condition is
   met. It is mostly used to return to a previously saved state if the
   simulation process fails to met a condition (e.g. a disease allele
   is lost).


   .. method:: RevertIf(cond, fromPop="", ops=[], output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Replaces the current evolving population by a population loaded
      from *fromPop*, which should be a file saved by function
      ``Population.save()`` or operator :class:`SavePopulation`. If a
      Python expression (a string) is given to parameter *cond*, the
      expression will be evalulated in each population's local
      namespace when this operator is applied. When a Python function
      with optional parameter ``pop`` is specified, it should accept
      the current population (to parameter ``pop``) and converts and
      return ``True`` or ``False``. Otherwise, parameter *cond* will
      be treated as a fixed condition (converted to ``True`` or
      ``False``) upon which the population is reverted. After the
      population is reverted, an optional list of operators *ops*
      could be applied to the population.
