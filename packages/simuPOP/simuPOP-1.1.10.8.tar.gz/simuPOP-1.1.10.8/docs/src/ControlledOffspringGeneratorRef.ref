class ControlledOffspringGenerator
----------------------------------

.. class:: ControlledOffspringGenerator

   This offspring generator populates an offspring population and
   controls allele frequencies at specified loci. At each generation,
   expected allele frequencies at these loci are passed from a user
   defined allele frequency *trajectory* function. The offspring
   population is populated in two steps. At the first step, only
   families with disease alleles are accepted until until the expected
   number of disease alleles are met. At the second step, only
   families with wide type alleles are accepted to populate the rest
   of the offspring generation. This method is described in detail in
   "Peng et al, (2007) PLoS Genetics".


   .. method:: ControlledOffspringGenerator(loci, alleles, freqFunc, ops=[], numOffspring=1, sexMode=RANDOM_SEX)


      Create an offspring generator that selects offspring so that
      allele frequency at specified loci in the offspring generation
      reaches specified allele frequency. At the beginning of each
      generation, expected allele frequency of *alleles* at *loci* is
      returned from a user-defined trajectory function *freqFunc*.
      Parameter *loci* can be a list of loci indexes, names, or
      ALL_AVAIL. If there is no subpopulation, this function should
      return a list of frequencies for each locus. If there are
      multiple subpopulations, *freqFunc* can return a list of allele
      frequencies for all subpopulations or combined frequencies that
      ignore population structure. In the former case, allele
      frequencies should be arranged by loc0_sp0, loc1_sp0, ...
      loc0_sp1, loc1_sp1, ..., and so on. In the latter case, overall
      expected number of alleles are scattered to each subpopulation
      in proportion to existing number of alleles in each
      subpopulation, using a multinomial distribution.

      After the expected alleles are calculated, this offspring
      generator accept and reject families according to their genotype
      at *loci* until allele frequecies reach their expected values.
      The rest of the offspring generation is then filled with
      families without only wild type alleles at these *loci*.

      This offspring generator is derived from class
      *OffspringGenerator*. Please refer to class *OffspringGenerator*
      for a detailed description of parameters *ops*, *numOffspring*
      and *sexMode*.
