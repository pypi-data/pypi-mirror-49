===============
Supported Platforms & Requirements
===============
* Python 3.7 (should work on 3.5/3.6 too, but is untested).
* Django 2

``pip install django-xero`` should automatically download all necessary prerequisites, but I like
to give credit where credit is due.
We stand on the shoulders of the following giants:

* `django-encrypted-model-fields <https://gitlab.com/lansharkconsulting/django/django-encrypted-model-fields/>`_
* `pyxero <https://github.com/freakboy3742/pyxero>`_
