Description: An HTTP server that displays a directory listing, much like Python's
        default http.server module, except this one allows directory creation
        and file upload by the user.
        
        This can be useful anytime you want to quickly share files a directory,
        for example in a classroom where the students need to obtain one or
        more files from the instructor and need to upload their exercise.
        In that case the instructor finds out their machine's IP address,
        communicates the url ``http://ipaddress:port/`` to the students, opens
        a command window and runs httpuploader like this::
        
           $ python3 httpuploader.py -p port -d directory
        
        and they now have a quick server.
        
        Httpuploader is a single file with **no dependencies** outside the
        Python Standard Library. It is a WSGI application so that it can be
        imported as a module (the name is ``httpuploader.ul_serve``) and run
        in any WSGI compliant server like mod_wsgi, Rocket, uWSGI, etc.
        
        The client's browsers need Javascript activated. It won't work in old
        versions of Internet Explorer though. Get the latest version or Edge.
