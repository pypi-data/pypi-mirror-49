Description: anchor_txt: attributes in markdown
        
        anchor_txt adds the ability to embed attributes in markdown files so that external
        tools can more easily link them to eachother and code, as well as perform
        other operations.
        
        Use ``anchor_txt.Section.from_md_path`` to load a markdown file.
        
        # Markdown Syntax
        The syntax for anchor_txt attributes is simple.
        
        - Headers of the form `# header {#anchor}` will have the `anchor` tag extracted and available
          in `Header.anchor`
        - A header creates a Section, which can have sub `sections`.
        - Sections have attributes, which are embedded yaml either inline or in fenced
          code blocks, shown below.
        
        An inline attribute looks like one of these:
        ```
        `@{foo}`
        `@{bar: 2}`
        ```
        
        Fenced code block attributes look like below. They must include the identifier
        `yaml` (or `json`) and end with a `@`
        
            ```yaml @
            foo: null
            bar: 2
            ```
        
        Attributes blocks within a Section are combined through the same process as
        `dict.update`, except overlapping keys throw an error.
        
        # Developer
        Run `make init` to create the necessary virtualenv
        
        Run `make test` for basic tests or `make check` for lints and formatting.
