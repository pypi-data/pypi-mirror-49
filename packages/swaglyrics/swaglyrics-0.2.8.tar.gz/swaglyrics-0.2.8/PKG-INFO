        Fetches the currently playing song from Spotify on Windows, Linux and macOS and displays the lyrics in the command-line or in a browser tab.
        Refreshes automatically when song changes. The lyrics are fetched from Genius.
        Turns out Deezer already has this feature in-built but with `swaglyrics`, you can have it in Spotify as well.
        
        I'm mainly trying to build this project as far as I can,
        for practice and to learn and work with more technologies and platforms.
        
        Initially developed this for personal use. Pretty much functionality oriented -- I usually develop something that I
        can see helping me and other users in the same situation.
        Packaged so I can first hand handle production-ready code to an extent and to make
        distribution and usage easier.
        
        ## Installation
        Requires Python3. Use pip or pip3 depending on your installation. You might want to use the `--user` flag on Linux to
        avoid using pip as root.
        ```
        pip install swaglyrics
        ```
        Make sure to use a version >= 0.1.6 since the previous ones don't have the `tab` option supported.
        
        ## Usage
        `usage: swaglyrics [-h] [-t] [-c] [-n]`
        
        Either the tab or cli argument is required to output lyrics.
        
        Arguments:
        ```
          -h, --help      show this help message and exit       
          -t, --tab       Display lyrics in a browser tab.      
          -c, --cli       Display lyrics in the command-line.   
          -n, --no-issue  Disable issue-making on cli.
        ```
        You can quit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>

        ## Compiling SwagLyrics for Development
        
        - Clone the repo by `git clone https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify.git` or use ssh.
        - `cd` into the cloned repo.
        - `pip install -e .` the -e flag installs it locally in editable mode.
        
        ## Improvements Planned
        1. ~~Linux and macOS support **done**~~
        2. ~~Better logging of unsupported songs, the isolated unsupported.txt is sub-optimal for multiple users since the
        file will only update locally with songs which worked fine when it was just me but since I hope others use it too, I'll
        try to add a better method with server support.~~
        3. Better tests to test all of the functionality. (cli.py fully tested!)
        4. Perhaps a tiny app using Electron that could fit in your tray to be opened whenever you want lyrics for a song.
        5. ~~Supporting more songs, currently the program sometimes fails at remixes since while the lyrics are same as 
        original,
         the artist is the remixer. **done**~~
        6. Documenting all the files.
