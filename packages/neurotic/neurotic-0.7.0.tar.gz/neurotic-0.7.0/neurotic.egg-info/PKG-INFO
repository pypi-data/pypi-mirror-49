        **neurotic** is an app that allows you to easily review and annotate your
        electrophysiology data and simultaneously captured video. It is an easy way to
        load your Neo_-compatible data into ephyviewer_ without doing any programming.
        Share a single metadata file with your colleagues and they too will quickly be
        looking at the same datasets!
        
        To use the app, first organize your datasets in a YAML file like this (see
        `Configuring Metadata`_):
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            my favorite dataset:
                description: This time it actually worked!
        
                data_dir:           C:/local_dir_containing_files
                remote_data_dir:    http://myserver/remote_dir_containing_downloadable_files  # optional
                data_file:          data.axgx
                video_file:         video.mp4
                # etc
        
                video_offset: -3.4  # seconds between start of video and data acq
                epoch_encoder_possible_labels:
                    - label01
                    - label02
                plots:
                    - channel: I2
                      ylim: [-30, 30]
                    - channel: RN
                      ylim: [-60, 60]
                    # etc
        
                filters:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
                    - channel: Force
                      lowpass: 50
                    # etc
                amplitude_discriminators:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
                    - name: B3 neuron
                      channel: BN2
                      amplitude: [50, 100]
                    # etc
        
            another dataset:
                # etc
        
        Open your YAML metadata file in **neurotic** and choose a dataset. If the data
        and video files aren't already on your local computer, the app can download
        them for you, even from a password-protected server. Finally, click launch and
        the app will use a standard viewer layout to display your data to you using
        ephyviewer_.
        
        |Example screenshot|
        
        *(Pictured above is a voracious Aplysia californica in the act of making the
        researcher very happy.)*
        
        The viewers are easy and intuitive to navigate (see `User Interface`_):
        
        - Pressing the play button will scroll through your data and video in real
          time, or at a higher or lower rate if the speed parameter is changed.
        - The arrow/WASD keys allow you to step through time in variable increments.
        - Jump to a time by clicking on an event in the event list or a table entry in
          the epoch encoder.
        - To show more or less time at once, right-click and drag right or left to
          contract or expand time.
        - Scroll the mouse wheel in the trace viewer or video viewer to zoom.
        - The epoch encoder can be used to block out periods of time during which
          something interesting is happening for later review or further analysis
          (saved to a CSV file).
        - All panels can be hidden, undocked, stacked, or repositioned on the fly.
        
        Electrophysiologists will find this tool useful even if they don't need the
        video synchronization feature!
        
        **Portability is easy with neurotic!** Use relative paths in your metadata file
        along with a remotely accessible data store such as GIN_ to make your metadata
        file fully portable. The same metadata file could be copied to a different
        computer, and downloaded files will automatically be saved to the right place.
        Data stores can be password protected and **neurotic** will prompt you for a
        user name and password. This makes it easy to share the **neurotic** experience
        with your colleagues! ðŸ¤ª
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **neurotic** requires Python 3.6 or later. It needs PyAV_, which is most easily
        installed from conda-forge_. It also does not explicitly list any of its
        dependencies within the package metadata [1]_, so they must be installed
        manually.
        
        To install PyAV and all other dependencies, use these commands (``pip`` may
        raise a non-fatal error that can be ignored; see [2]_)::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge av
            pip install "elephant>=0.6.2" "ephyviewer>=1.1.0" "neo>=0.7.2" numpy packaging pandas pylttb pyqt5 pyyaml quantities tqdm
        
        Finally, install the latest release version of **neurotic** from PyPI_, using
        ::
        
            pip install -U neurotic
        
        or install the latest development version from GitHub_ using ::
        
            pip install -U git+https://github.com/jpgill86/neurotic.git
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Launch the standalone app from the command line::
        
            neurotic
        
        A simple example is provided. Select the "example dataset", download the
        associated data (~7 MB), and then click "Launch". See `User Interface`_ for
        help with navigation.
        
        Disabling "Fast loading" before launch will enable additional features
        including amplitude-threshold spike detection and signal filtering.
        
        The command line interface accepts arguments as well:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            usage: neurotic [-h] [-V] [--no-lazy] [--thick-traces]
                            [--theme {light,dark,original}]
                            [file] [dataset]
        
            neurotic lets you curate, visualize, and annotate your behavioral ephys data.
        
            positional arguments:
              file                  the path to a metadata YAML file (default: an example
                                    file)
              dataset               the name of a dataset in the metadata file to select
                                    initially (default: the first entry in the metadata
                                    file)
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
              --no-lazy             do not use fast loading (default: use fast loading)
              --thick-traces        enable support for traces with thick lines, which has
                                    a performance cost (default: disable thick line
                                    support)
              --theme {light,dark,original}
                                    a color theme for the GUI (default: light)
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        .. [1] Before **neurotic** can be configured to automatically install
               dependencies, an `upstream library conflict`_ must be fixed. This should
               be resolved soon; until then, dependencies can be installed manually.
        
        .. [2] The following warning may appear during dependency installation but can
               be ignored because the incompatibility between these versions is
               trivial: ``ERROR: elephant 0.6.2 has requirement neo<0.8.0,<=0.7.1, but
               you'll have neo 0.7.2 which is incompatible``. This is related to the
               `upstream library conflict`_ previously mentioned.
