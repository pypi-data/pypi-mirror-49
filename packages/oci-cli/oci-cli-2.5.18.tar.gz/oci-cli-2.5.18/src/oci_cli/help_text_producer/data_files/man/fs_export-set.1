.SS Options
.SS \-\-export\-set\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the export set. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable.
.sp
Example: \fIMy resource\fP
.SS \-\-lifecycle\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED|FAILED]
.sp
Filter results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type.

.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
The sort order to use, either \(aqasc\(aq or \(aqdesc\(aq, where \(aqasc\(aq is ascending and \(aqdesc\(aq is descending.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-export\-set\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the export set. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIMy export set\fP
.SS \-\-max\-fs\-stat\-bytes [integer]
.sp
Controls the maximum \fItbytes\fP, \fIfbytes\fP, and \fIabytes\fP values reported by \fINFS FSSTAT\fP calls through any associated mount targets. This is an advanced feature. For most applications, use the default value. The \fItbytes\fP value reported by \fIFSSTAT\fP will be \fImaxFsStatBytes\fP\&. The value of \fIfbytes\fP and \fIabytes\fP will be \fImaxFsStatBytes\fP minus the metered size of the file system. If the metered size is larger than \fImaxFsStatBytes\fP, then \fIfbytes\fP and \fIabytes\fP will both be \(aq0\(aq.
.SS \-\-max\-fs\-stat\-files [integer]
.sp
Controls the maximum \fIffiles\fP, \fIffiles\fP, and \fIafiles\fP values reported by \fINFS FSSTAT\fP calls through any associated mount targets. This is an advanced feature. For most applications, use the default value. The \fItfiles\fP value reported by \fIFSSTAT\fP will be \fImaxFsStatFiles\fP\&. The value of \fIffiles\fP and \fIafiles\fP will be \fImaxFsStatFiles\fP minus the metered size of the file system. If the metered size is larger than \fImaxFsStatFiles\fP, then \fIffiles\fP and \fIafiles\fP will both be \(aq0\(aq.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
