Description: # Binary/Hexadecimal/Decimal/Octal Conversion
        This module allows you to convert binary, hexadecimal, decimal and octal (base16, base2, base10 and base8) numbers between one another.
        
        The functions setup within this module are as follows:
        #### Conversion from binary
        ```python
        binHex(number)
        binDec(number)
        binOct(number)
        ```
        
        #### Conversion from hexadecimal
        ```python
        hexBin(number)
        hexDec(number)
        hexOct(number)
        ```
        
        #### Conversion from decimal
        ```python
        decBin(number)
        decHex(number)
        decOct(number)
        ```
        
        #### Conversion from octal
        ```python
        octBin(number)
        octHex(number)
        octDec(number)
        ```
        ###
        ##### How to use the functions properly
        1. **Conversion from binary** - You do not need to have at least 8 bits of information and you can have more than 8.
        2. **Conversion from hexadecimal** - You do not need to have "0x" before the hexadecimal value.
        3. **Conversion from decimal** - You can enter any integer you want.
        4. **Conversion from octal** - You do not have to have "0o" before the octal value.
