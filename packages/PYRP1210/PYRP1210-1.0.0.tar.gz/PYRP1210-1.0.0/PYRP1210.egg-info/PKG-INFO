        ## Quick Start
        
        Use 32-bit Python 3 only.
        
        Install with `pip install PyRP1210`
        
        Run with `python demo1.py`  (which needs to be created still)
        
        ## Description
        
        An RP1210 library for python
        
        
        ### Packaging
        
        Open a command prompt (cmd) that has the python path ready to go. In the `PyRP1210` directory (or wherever you saved the file) we will perform the following actions.
        
          1. Check dependencies and create an up to date `requirements.txt` file by running 
        
        ```pipreqs /path/to/project```
        
         or 
        
         ```pipreqs --force ./``` if you are already in the  `TruckCRYPT` directory
        
        If this doesn't work, try ```pip install pipreqs``` first.
        
          1. Remove the setup utilities, if they are in requirements.txt
        
          2. Build a wheel
        
         ```python setup.py bdist_wheel```
        
          3. Upload to PiPy
        
        ```twine upload dist/*```
        
        If you get `HTTPError: 400 Client Error: File already exists. for url: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/`, then make sure you update the version number in setup.py. You'll have to delete the old dist directory and try steps 2 and 3 again.
