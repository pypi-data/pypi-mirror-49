This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
