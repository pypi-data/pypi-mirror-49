master
------
(`#62 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/62>`_) Add inverse carbon cycle to diagnose emissions from concentrations

(`#60 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/60>`_) Refactor carbon cycle into separate function

(`#4 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/issues/4>`_) Make ``iirf_h`` a keyword parameter

(`#57 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/57>`_) Update to the ensemble generator to use the variance of the input data rather than the standard deviation

(`#52 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/52>`_) Fixed bug that didn't pick up first year of CO2 concentrations and radiative forcing after restart_in. Changed internal book-keeping of CO2 concentrations to be absolute, rather than anomaly from pre-industrial, to be consistent with other GHGs.

(`#49 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/issues/49>`_) Change name of model to FaIR in docs, README and example notebooks

(`#47 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/47>`_) Remove ``requirements.txt`` and add ``.readthedocs.yml`` to put install requirements all in one place
