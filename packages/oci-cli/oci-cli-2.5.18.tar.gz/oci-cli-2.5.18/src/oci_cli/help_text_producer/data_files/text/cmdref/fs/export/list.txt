The OCID of the file system.


--lifecycle-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED|FAILED]

Filter results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state
for the resource type.


--id [text]
-----------

Filter results by OCID. Must be an OCID of the correct type for the
resouce type.


--sort-by [TIMECREATED|PATH]
----------------------------

The field to sort by. You can provide either value, but not both. By
default, when you sort by time created, results are shown in
descending order. When you sort by path, results are shown in
ascending alphanumeric order.


--sort-order [ASC|DESC]
-----------------------

The sort order to use, either 'asc' or 'desc', where 'asc' is
ascending and 'desc' is descending.


--all
-----

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the --limit option.


--page-size [integer]
---------------------

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
