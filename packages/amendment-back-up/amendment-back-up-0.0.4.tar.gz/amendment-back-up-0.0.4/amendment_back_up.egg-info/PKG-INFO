        ## Motivation
        When it comes to backing up a large amout of data, it is often preferable to only copy the modified and unique files, rather than simply coping the whole directory. The `AmendmentBackUp` (`ABU`) class provides a simple interface to do that. No dependencies are required apart from the Python 3 standard library.
        
        ## Design
        Say we have two folders, a source folder `dir1` which you have your most recent files and a reference folder `dir2` which holds some of your previous backup. What the `ABU` does is to compare all files in `dir1` with those in `dir2`, and copy the files to a third destination folder `dst`. If you simply want to add the files to the original back, you can set `dst` to `dir2`.
        
        ## A quick example
        
        
        
        
        ## Limitation
        The `ABU` is best suited for when the source folder `dir1` is a natural growth of the reference folder `dir2`. What I mean by *natural growth* is that there should not be too much renaming or move of the subfolders from `dir2` to `dir1`. If that's the case, using a version control system is probably a better option.
