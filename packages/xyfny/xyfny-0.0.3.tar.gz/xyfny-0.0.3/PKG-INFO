Description: # xyfny - a z-machine intepreter
        
        This is based closely upon theinternetftw's `xyppy`.
        
        Where that is geared towards an interactive simulation of a good ol'-fashioned Z-machine
        experience, this is intended to be plugging into event-driven systems (for instance,
        chat systems like Slack).
        
        All of the terminal handling is stripped out. Rather, the z-machine runs until it attempts
        to read input from the user. At that point, it'll exit with an interrupt - _unless_ there
        is user input pending in its buffer.
        
        The basic gist of how this might be used:
        
            # Initialise
            env = make_env(file)
            intro = do_step(env, line)
            
            # Output the introductory text to the user
            output(intro)
            
            # On receiving an input event from the user:
            response = do_step(env, event_text)
            output(response)
