Description: # pynspector
        The `human-friendly` python objects inspector
        
        ### What is pynspector?
        Pynspector is a library for easily inspecting python objects. It wraps the "inspect" library and adds some extra
        features to make it more powerful and easy to use.
        
        I've been playing with `inspect` library some time, and after cracking my brain I just decided to start this new project.
        
        But that's not the only thing it does by default (wrapping the `inspect` library) it also adds support for being able
        to parse docstrings and return all specifications defined for a function.
