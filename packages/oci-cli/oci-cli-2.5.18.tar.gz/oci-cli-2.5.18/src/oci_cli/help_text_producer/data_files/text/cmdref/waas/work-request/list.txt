Options
=======


--waas-policy-id [text]
-----------------------

The OCID of the policy. [required]


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment. This number is generated when the
compartment is created. [required]


--limit [integer]

The maximum number of items to return in a paginated call. In
unspecified, defaults to *10*.


--page [text]
-------------

The value of the *opc-next-page* response header from the previous
paginated call.


--sort-by [id|status|timeAccepted|timeStarted|timeFinished|operationType]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The value by which work requests are sorted in a paginated 'List'
call. If unspecified, defaults to *timeAccepted*.


--sort-order [ASC|DESC]
-----------------------

The value of the sorting direction of resources in a paginated 'List'
call. If unspecified, defaults to *DESC*.


--all
-----

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the --limit option.


--page-size [integer]
---------------------

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
