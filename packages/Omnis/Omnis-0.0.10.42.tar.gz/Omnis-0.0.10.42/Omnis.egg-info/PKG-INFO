        ## You have just found Omnis.
        
        Omnis is a library of deep neural network applications, written in Python and capable of running on top of [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast application of deep learning.
        
        Use Omnis if you need a deep learning library that:
        
        - Is EASY to learn.
        - Allows for easy and fast use.
        - Supports CNN, LSTM, GAN applications.
        
        Omnis is compatible with: __Python 3.6-3.7__.
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Getting started: Implement a deep learning application with 4 lines of code!
        
        The core data structure of Omnis is Application which is designed to be easy to use in each field.
        
        Here is an `Image Classification` example with the [`Caltech 101`](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/) dataset:
        
        ```python
        from omnis.application.image_processing.image_classification.image_classification import ImageClassification
        ```
        
        Choose an application:
        
        ```python
        image_classifier = ImageClassification()
        ```
        
        Train:
        
        ```python
        image_classifier.train(data_path='101_ObjectCategories', epochs=5, batch_size=32, model_type='densent121')
        ```
        
        Now you can use the application to classify images:
        
        ```python
        prediction_result = image_classifier.predict(data_path = '101_ObjectCategories/accordion')
        
        print(prediction_result)
        ```
        
        Save / Load:
        
        ```python
        image_classifier.save(model_path="weights.h5")
        ```
        ```python
        image_classifier = ImageClassification(model_path="weights.h5")
        ```

        ------------------
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Before installing Omnis, please prepare NVIDIA GPU(s) and install TensorFlow GPU and Keras using conda.
        
        Then, you can install Omnis itself. There are two ways to install Omnis:
        
        - **Install Omnis from PyPI (recommended):**
        
        If you don't use a conda virtual environment, you can run the command below (not recommended):
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install omnis
        ```
        
        If you are using a conda virtual environment, you may want to avoid using sudo:
        
        ```sh
        pip install omnis
        ```
        
        - **Alternatively: install Omnis from the GitHub source:**
        
        First, clone Omnis using `git`:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/omnis-labs-company/omnis.git
        ```
        
         Then, `cd` to the Omnis folder and run the install command:
        ```sh
        cd omnis
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Guiding principles
        
        - __Simplicity.__ Omnis pursues a simple architecture. Designing a software with simple architecture not only helps you to understand the code easily but also helps your painful debugging.
        
        - __Easiness.__ Don't worry about complicated algorithms or theories or mathematics. Omnis will handle difficult stuffs for you. Just learn how to use deep neural networks and USE THIS!
        
        - __Modularity.__ No spaghetti code!
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Support
        
        You can ask questions and join the development 
        
        - On the [Omnis Slack channel](https://omnisteamworkspace.slack.com).
        
        You can also post **bug reports and feature requests** (only) in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/omnis-labs-company/omnis/issues). Make sure to read [our guidelines](https://github.com/omnis-labs-company/omnis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Why this name, Omnis?
        
        Omnis means _EVERY_ in Latin. The goal of Omnis is to make deep learning technologies easier so that _EVERY_ one can use deep learning technologies without headache.
