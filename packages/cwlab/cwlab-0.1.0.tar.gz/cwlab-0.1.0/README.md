# CWLab
A framework for simplified, graphical deployment of CWL

CWLab allows life-science researchers with all levels of computational proficiency to create, execute and monitor jobs for CWL-wrapped tools and workflows. Input parameters for large sample batches are specified using a simple HTML form or a spreadsheet and are automatically validated. The integrated web server allows to remotely control execution on single workstations, clusters, or other computational systems supported by CWL runners. Moreover, we are currently implementing automatic infrastructure provisioning and scaling for OpenStack-based clouds. Alternatively, CWLab can run locally as a desktop application. Our framework is entirely based on Python, easy to set up, and supports execution on Linux, MacOS as well as Windows by leveraging Docker containerization.
