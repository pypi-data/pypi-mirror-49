.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A compute host. The image used to launch the instance determines its operating system and other software. The shape specified during the launch process determines the number of CPUs and memory allocated to the instance. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
The action to perform on the instance. Allowed values are: STOP, START, SOFTRESET, RESET, SOFTSTOP [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|RUNNING|STARTING|STOPPING|STOPPED|CREATING_IMAGE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp

.SS launch
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified availability domain. For general information about instances, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the \fIsourceDetails\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet\(aqs CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic\fP> with the VNIC ID.
.sp
You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the \(aqmetadata\(aq object.

.SS \-\-fault\-domain [text]
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you. To change the fault domain for an instance, terminate it and launch a new instance in the preferred fault domain.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

.SS \-\-image\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the image used to boot the instance. This is a shortcut for specifying an image source via the \-\-source\-details complex JSON parameter. If this parameter is provided, you cannot provide the \-\-source\-details or \-\-source\-boot\-volume\-id parameters.
.SS \-\-ipxe\-script\-file [filename]
.sp
This is an advanced option.
.sp
When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.
.sp
If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.
.sp
The default iPXE script connects to the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
