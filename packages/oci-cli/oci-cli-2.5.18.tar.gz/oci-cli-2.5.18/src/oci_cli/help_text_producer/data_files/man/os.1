.SS bucket
.SS Description
.sp
A bucket is a container for storing objects in a compartment within a namespace. A bucket is associated with a single compartment. The compartment has policies that indicate what actions a user can perform on a bucket and all the objects in the bucket. For more information, see \fI\%Managing Buckets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket. Valid characters are uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. Bucket names must be unique within an Object Storage namespace. Avoid entering confidential information. example: Example: my\-new\-bucket1 [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The ID of the compartment in which to create the bucket. [required]
.SS \-\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Arbitrary string, up to 4KB, of keys and values for user\-defined metadata.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-public\-access\-type [NoPublicAccess|ObjectRead|ObjectReadWithoutList]
.sp
The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to \fINoPublicAccess\fP by default, which only allows an authenticated caller to access the bucket and its contents. When \fIObjectRead\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP, \fIHeadObject\fP, and \fIListObjects\fP operations. When \fIObjectReadWithoutList\fP is enabled on the bucket, public access is allowed for the \fIGetObject\fP and \fIHeadObject\fP operations.
.SS \-\-storage\-tier [Standard|Archive]
.sp
The type of storage tier of this bucket. A bucket is set to \(aqStandard\(aq tier by default, which means the bucket will be put in the standard storage tier. When \(aqArchive\(aq tier type is set explicitly, the bucket is put in the Archive Storage tier. The \(aqstorageTier\(aq property is immutable after bucket is created.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.SS ns
.SS Description
.sp
A namespace is a logical entity that serves as a top\-level container for all buckets and objects, allowing you to control bucket naming within your tenancy. Each tenancy is provided one unique and uneditable namespace that is global, spanning all regions and compartments. While bucket names must be unique within your namespace, bucket names within your namespace can duplicate bucket names used in the namespaces of other tenants.
.sp
Namespace metadata stores the compartment assignments for resources created by the Amazon S3 Compatibility API and the Swift API. By default, resources created by the Amazon S3 Compatibility and Swift APIs are stored in the root compartment of the tenancy.

.sp
Each Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenant is assigned one unique and uneditable Object Storage namespace. The namespace is a system\-generated string assigned during account creation. For some older tenancies, the namespace string may be the tenancy name in all lower\-case letters. You cannot edit a namespace.
.sp
GetNamespace returns the name of the Object Storage namespace for the user making the request. If an optional compartmentId query parameter is provided, GetNamespace returns the namespace name of the corresponding tenancy, provided the user has access to it.

.SS \-\-destination\-object\-if\-match\-e\-tag [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to match against that of the destination object (an object intended to be overwritten). Used to confirm that the destination object stored under a given name is the version of that object storing a specified entity tag.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-if\-none\-match\-e\-tag [text]
.sp
The entity tag (ETag) to avoid matching. The only valid value is \(aq*\(aq, which indicates that the request should fail if the object already exists in the destination bucket.
.SS \-\-destination\-object\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Arbitrary string keys and values for the user\-defined metadata for the object. Keys must be in "opc\-meta\-

" format. Avoid entering confidential information. Metadata key\-value pairs entered in this field are assigned to the destination object. If you enter no metadata values, the destination object will inherit any existing metadata values associated with the source object.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|COMPLETED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.SS preauth\-request
.SS Description
.sp
Pre\-authenticated requests provide a way to let users access a bucket or an object without having their own credentials. When you create a pre\-authenticated request, a unique URL is generated. Users in your organization, partners, or third parties can use this URL to access the targets identified in the pre\-authenticated request. See \fI\%Using Pre\-Authenticated Requests\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
