# Eucalyptus - BDD plugin for Pytest
> A nice fork of [Aloe](https://github.com/aloetesting/aloe). 
Migrated from Nose to Pytest.

**pytest-eucalyptus** has been built to feature the best of both worlds: 
- [Aloe](https://github.com/aloetesting/aloe) which implements great infrastructure and uses the original Gherkin parser.
- [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd) does not require a separate runner and benefits from the power and flexibility of Pytest.


Install:

    pip install pytest-eucalyptus
