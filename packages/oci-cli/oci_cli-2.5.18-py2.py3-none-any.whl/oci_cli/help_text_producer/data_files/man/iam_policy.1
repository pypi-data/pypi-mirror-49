.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A document that specifies the type of access a group has to the resources in a compartment. For information about policies and other IAM Service components, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. If you\(aqre new to policies, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The word "policy" is used by people in different ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
An individual statement written in the policy language   * A collection of statements in a single, named "policy" document (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)   * The overall body of policies your organization uses to control access to resources

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new policy in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or another of your compartments). If you\(aqre new to policies, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a \fIname\fP for the policy, which must be unique across all policies in your tenancy and cannot be changed.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the policy (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdatePolicy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Policy/UpdatePolicy\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify one or more policy statements in the statements array. For information about writing policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP> and \fI\%Common Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
New policies take effect typically within 10 seconds.

.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|INACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
