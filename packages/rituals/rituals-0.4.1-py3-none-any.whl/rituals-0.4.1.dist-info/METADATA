The ``rituals`` package provides PyInvoke tasks that work for any
project, based on its project metadata, to automate common
developer chores like 'clean', 'build', 'dist', 'test', 'check',
and 'release-prep' (for the moment).

The guiding principle for these tasks is to strictly separate
low-level tasks for building and installing (via ``setup.py``) from
high-level convenience tasks a developer uses (via ``tasks.py``).
Invoke tasks can use Setuptools ones as building blocks, but
never the other way 'round – this avoids bootstrapping head-
aches during package installations using ``pip``.

The easiest way to get a working project based on ``rituals`` is
the ``py-generic-project`` cookiecutter template. That way you have
a working project skeleton within minutes that is fully equipped,
with all aspects of bootstrapping, building, testing, quality
checks, continuous integration, documentation, and releasing
covered. See here for more:
