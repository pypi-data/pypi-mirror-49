Description: # Delegate
        ### A python library for delegation (the metaprogramming feature)
        
        This library adds the `@delegate` decorator which may be used to delegate
        attributes from an attribute of the existing class. For example:
        
        ```python
        from delegate import delegate
        
        class Parent:
            def __init__(self):
                self.a = "a"
                self.b = "b"
                self.d = "d"
        
        # The delegate decorator makes .a and .b available on Child, through its
        # "parent" attribute, as though Child had an a and b attribute itself.
        @delegate("a", "b", to="parent")
        class Child:
            def __init__(self):
                self.parent = Parent()
                self.c = "c"
        
        instance = Child()
        assert instance.a == "a"
        raised = False
        try:
            # But d is not available
            instance.d
        except e:
            raised = True
        
        assert raised
        ```
