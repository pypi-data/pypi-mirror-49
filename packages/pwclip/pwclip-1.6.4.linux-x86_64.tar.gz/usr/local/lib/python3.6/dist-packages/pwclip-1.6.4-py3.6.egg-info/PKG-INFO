        Description
        -----------
        
        pwclip is a password management tool. It's main target is having fast and
        comfortable access to passwords by storing them for a variable time in the
        systems clipboard (copy/paste buffer). It uses either GnuPG2 or OpenSSL
        (converted to GPGSM) keys for cryptographic operations. It also works with
        yubikey's challenge-response to generate uniq HMAC-SHA1 hashes as well.
        
        The main feature is the pwcli/pwclip mode which provides easy access to the
        ~/.passcrypt file. That file is used by default as password storage. The
        program is executed in gui mode when pwclip is called and in cli mode when
        pwcli is called respectivly. It creates the ~/.passcrypt file which is gpg
        encrypted text using either the value of GPGKEY or GPGKEYS from the users
        environment as gpg encryption recipients. On startup it lookes for a
        ~/.pwd.yaml file which is merged with the already known passwords from the
        ~/.passcrypt file if there already is one. All entrys in the ~/.passcrypt file
        will be overridden by entrys from the ~/.pwd.yaml file. Adding, removing or
        changing password entrys is also possible using pwcli mode.
        
        The second operating mode is for operating on yubikeys to generate uniq
        responses which might be used as passwords while they can be generated by that
        exact yubikey only. The first yubikey found on the system and the first slot,
        configured with (HMAC-SHA1) challenge-response, will be used. For that function
        Windows is supported (see "Install" section).
        
        To catch user input python's Tk (tkinter) library is used to create a simple
        password input window. The appropriate response is saved for only 3 seconds
        by default to not have it exposed as soon as it's used. The utility also
        supports the input of any integer which is then used as timer. Otherwise the
        environment is searched for PWCLIPTIME and uses the value of that environment
        variable as timer. The timer is used as time in which the received password
        stays in the paste buffer bevore its replaced by the previously copied value.
        As you may see there is an optional commet which is used as text notification
        displayed on the screen if set. Therefor python3's gi notify2 is used which is
        another reason for discontinuing python2 support.
        
        I would encourage you to bind pwclip to a shortcut within your X-Environment
        to have access to your passwords at any time. On Windows-Systems you need to
        create a link for it somewhere. When editing that link you may set a keyboard
        shortcut (could not find a nicer solution by now). The target for that link
        then whould be "%PYTHONINSTALLDIR%\\scripts\\pwclip.exe".
        
        I've been trying my best to keep the passwords from unwanted access BUT i do
        !NOT GUARANTEE! that the passwords handled during runtime are safe from other
        users access (especially "root" on linux systems - help on that is very
        welcome) - please be aware of that!
        
        Since version 1.2 openssl keys are supported. For the use with pwclip they will
        be converted to gpg-keys automaticly and gpgsm is used instead of gpg - openssl
        is not used for en/decryption to be precisely.
        
        The ~/.pwd.yaml as well as the ~/.passcrypt file is assembled as a list of one
        or more users which should be named like the username used for current system
        login. You may have more than one users passwords in the passcrypt but any user
        who can store passwords also is able to read password stored for other users in
        that file. It is just of use for visual kategories if you have stored passwords
        for different systems users sharing the same passcrypt file.
        As an example: A person called "Andrew" has a username called "bob". On some
        other machine he has a username called "cat" and he uses SSH for both of them.
        The shared passcrypt file would be assembled like the attached YAML-Format
        section. If so providing -u or -A when beeing logged in as "bob" or "cat"
        respectivly may be omitted. In the following example both, "bob" and "cat" have
        an entry called ssh. If -A is used in that case the entry corresponding to the
        logged-in user is prefered. If in doubt you're able to read the crypt file
        using "gpg -d ~/.passcrypt" as well (assuming the correct gpg-key is present).
        
        YAML-Format
        -----------
        
        \-\-\-
        
        bob:
            \- ssh:
        
                \- $om3(rypt!cPass
        
                \- DoNotForgetSomethingReminder
        
            \- othertool:
        
                \- 0th3r(rypt!cPass
        
        cat:
            \- ssh:
        
                \- $om30ther(rypticPass
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        On Windows you need to install Python3 from http://python.org/ first. On most
        Linux distributions python will be part of the system. With Python installed,
        you can install the pwclip package from the Python-Package-Index (pyPI) by
        running:
        
        ``pip3 install pwclip``
        
        and installing the dependencies (not managed by pip) manually.
        
        Installing from source
        ----------------------
        
        To install this package from a source distribution archive, do the following:
        
        1. Extract all the files in the distribution archive to some directory on your
           system.
        
        2. In that directory, run:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        Installing via apt
        ------------------
        
        curl deb.janeiskla.de/ubuntu/project/d0ndeb-pub.key | apt-key add -
        apt-get update
        apt-get install python3-pwclip
        
        Usage
        -----
        
            Although is was planed as GUI-Program it's also possible to be executed from
            terminals. For Windows, Linux and OSX there is an appropriate executable
            packed which might be executed like the following examples will show:
        
            **-GPG-Mode-**
        
            If there is an environment variable called GPGKEYS it will use those keys to
            encrypt on changes to the password file. To list the password file you may use
            the list switch followed by optional search pattern like:
        
            ``pwcli -l``
        
            or
        
            ``pwcli -l $PATTERN``
        
            as you can see the yaml format tends to be used for multiple user names to
            better manage large lists. By default the current users entrys will be listed
            only. To have them all listed (or searched for by the above pattern example)
            use:
        
            ``pwcli -A -l $PATTERN``
        
            To one-shot convert a key/cert pair in openssl x509 format, read passwords from
            passwords.yaml and list them:
        
            ``pwcli -Y passwords.yaml --cert ssl.crt --key ssl.key --ca-cert ca.crt -l``
        
            **-Yubikey-Mode-**
        
            The YKSERIAL environment variable is used if found to select the yubikey to use
            if more than one key is connected. Otherwise the first one found is chosen.
            Likewise it also accepts an option:
        
            ``pwcli -y $YKSERIAL``
        
            To have it wait for a specific time like 60 seconds (bevore resetting the paste
            buffer to the previously copied value) the PWCLIPTIME environment variable is
            used or also the command accepts it as input:
        
            ``pwcli -t 60 -l somename``
        
            Most of the options may be combined. For more information on possible options in
            cli mode please see:
        
            ``pwcli --help``
        
            **-GUI-Modes-**
        
            For the GUI-Mode just use one of the following commands, also accepting most of
            the commandline arguments:
        
            ``pwclip``
        
            ``ykclip``
        
        
        Troubleshoot
        ------------
        
        When using the yubikey challenge-response mode there is a bug in the usb_hid
        interface. This is because of python2 => 3 transition, most likely and can be
        fixed by executing the following command:
        
        ``sudo vi +':107s/\(.* =\).*/\1 response[0]/' +':wq' /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/yubico/yubikey_4_usb_hid.py``
        
        Explained:
        
        In line 107 of the file
        
        ``/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/yubico/yubikey_4_usb_hid.py``
        
        the ord() coversion of the response:
        
        ``r_len = ord(response[0])``
        
        needs to be replaced by:
        
        ``r_len = response[0]``
