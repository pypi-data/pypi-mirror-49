        ### Command Line Argumet Handling
        CliUtil comes with POSIX-complaint functions for handling command-line arguments.
        #### clarguments
        Handle arguments passed to the script through the command line. Any arguments with values will be returned as strings. Arguments with multiple values will have them comma separated inside of the string. Simple flags will have a value of type None.
        
        Argument | Type | Doc
        --- | --- | ---
        returns | Dict | Contains the variables and all the values assigned to them. Flags will have a None type.
        
        Example:
        ```bash
        python script.py -Snp 1 -r 10 -b "str" arg2 --long arg1 arg3
        ```
        Where script.py is
        ```python
        from cliutil.Arguments import clarguments
        arguments = clarguments()
        print(arguments)
        ```
        Will output
        ```python
        {
            '_args': 'arg2,arg3',
            'S': None,
            'n': None,
            'p': '1',
            'r': '10',
            'b': 'str',
