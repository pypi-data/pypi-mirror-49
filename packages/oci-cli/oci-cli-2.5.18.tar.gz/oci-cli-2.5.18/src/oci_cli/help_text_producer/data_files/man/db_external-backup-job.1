.SS Description
.sp
Changes the status of the standalone backup resource to \fIACTIVE\fP after the backup is created from the on\-premises database and placed in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage.

\fBNote:\fP This API is used by an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python script that is packaged with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI. Oracle recommends that you use the script instead using the API directly. See \fI\%Migrating an On\-Premises Database to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by Creating a Backup in the Cloud\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Tasks/mig-onprembackup.htm\fP> for more information.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-backup\-id [text]
.sp
The backup \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&. [required]
.SS \-\-tde\-wallet\-path [text]
.sp
If the database being backed up is TDE enabled, this will be the path to the associated TDE wallet in Object Storage.
.SS \-\-cf\-backup\-handle [text]
.sp
The handle of the control file backup.
.SS \-\-spf\-backup\-handle [text]
.sp
The handle of the spfile backup.
.SS \-\-sql\-patches [complex type]
.sp
The list of SQL patches that need to be applied to the backup during the restore.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-data\-size [integer]
.sp
The size of the data in the database, in megabytes.
.SS \-\-redo\-size [integer]
.sp
The size of the redo in the database, in megabytes.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
