class MitochondrialGenoTransmitter
----------------------------------

.. class:: MitochondrialGenoTransmitter

   This geno transmitter transmits the first homologous copy of a
   ``Mitochondrial`` chromosome. If no mitochondrial chromosome is
   present, it assumes that the first homologous copy of several (or
   all) ``Customized`` chromosomes are copies of mitochondrial
   chromosomes. This operator transmits the mitochondrial chromosome
   from the female parent to offspring for sexsual reproduction, and
   any parent to offspring for asexual reproduction. If there are
   multiple chromosomes, the organelles are selected randomly. If this
   transmitter is applied to populations with more than one homologous
   copies of chromosomes, it transmits the first homologous copy of
   chromosomes and clears alleles (set to zero) on other homologous
   copies.


   .. method:: MitochondrialGenoTransmitter(output="", chroms=ALL_AVAIL, begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Createa a mitochondrial genotype transmitter that treats the
      Mitochondiral chromosome, or Customized chromosomes if no
      Mitochondrial chromosome is specified, or a list of chromosomes
      specified by *chroms*, as human mitochondrial chromosomes. These
      chromosomes should have the same length and the same number of
      loci. This operator transmits these chromosomes randomly from
      the female parent to offspring of both sexes. It also copies
      allelic lineage when it is executed in a module with lineage
      allele type.
