        ### How to create filters
        
        Every filter inherits from base class `QuerySetFilter` and include two args: `key` and `lookup`. Filters apply via standard method queryset method `filter`. So, `lookup` will be used for filtering. `key` is an id of a filter and it is used when you provide to gallery engine dict with params for filtering. A filter gets param from dict via `key`.
        
        ```
        from queryset_gallery.filters import QuerySetFilter
        
        UserEmail = QuerySetFilter(
            key='email',
            lookup='email__icontains'
        )
        UserIsStaff = QuerySetFilter(
            key='is_staff',
            lookup='is_staff'
        )
        ```
        
        ### How to create a gallery
        
        A base class for a gallery in `QuerySetGallery`. When you need to create a gallery you provide django `model` and set `QuerySetFilter` objects in `filters` conts:
        
        ```
        from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        from queryset_gallery.gallery import QuerySetGallery
        
        class UserGallery(QuerySetGallery):
            model = User
            filters = [UserEmail, UserIsStaff]
        ```
        
        The gallery has a method `get_page`. It gets several params like:
        
        ```
        def get_page(self, page_number, per_page, filter_params: dict = None, order_by_lookups: list = None, queryset_params=None, queryset=None):
        ```
        
        The first and second args are params for paginator. The third arg `filter_params` is a dict with params for filters. It includes filter keys and params. Also, you can provide source `queryset` or override method `get_queryset`, by default all model objects will be used as a source. Also, if there additional params for getting queryset you can provide it via `queryset_params`. The last arg `order_by_lookups` is a list of lookups for queryset method `order_by()`. All lookups from a list will be applied to queryset. Finally the gallery return queryset and dict of pagination data.
        
        ```
        gallery = UserGallery()
        filter_params = {
            'email': 'admin',
            'is_staff': True,
        }
        
        gallery.get_page(per_page=10, page_number=1, filter_params=params, order_by_lookups=['email'])
        ```
        
        ### How to use simple search
        
        The simple search is a situation then there a list of params list `['Alex', 'Ambassador']` and several fields for filtering, for example, `first_name`, `last_name` and `nickname`. `QuerySetGallery` supports a simple search via `QuerySetSimpleSearch`. It's just a filter that can be added to const `filters`. For the example above `QuerySetSimpleSearch` create several Django Q objects with a condition OR and execute them. `QuerySetSimpleSearch` is created in the same way as `QuerySetFilter` but get a list of lookups instead of one lookup:
        
        ```
        from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        
        users = User.objects.all()
        
        UserSimpleSearch = QuerySetSimpleSearch(
            key='query',
            lookups=[
                'first_name__icontains',
                'last_name__icontains',
                'nickname__icontains'
            ]
        )
        UserSimpleSearch.apply(users, ['Alex', 'Ambassador'])
        ```
        
        ### How to work with pagination
        
        You don't need to work with `Paginator`, because the `QuerySetGallery` class works with it. The `QuerySetGallery` has two nuances. If you want to get all objects you can set `per_page` as -1. This way pagination returns all objects. If `per_page` and `necessary_page` are invalid it raises error 404.
        
        Example of the pagination data:
        
        ```
        data =  {
            'objects_count': 20,
            'page_number': 2,
            'page_count': 1,
            'per_page': 100,
        }
        ```
