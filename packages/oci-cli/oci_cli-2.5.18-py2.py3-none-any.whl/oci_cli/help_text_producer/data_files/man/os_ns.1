.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A namespace is a logical entity that serves as a top\-level container for all buckets and objects, allowing you to control bucket naming within your tenancy. Each tenancy is provided one unique and uneditable namespace that is global, spanning all regions and compartments. While bucket names must be unique within your namespace, bucket names within your namespace can duplicate bucket names used in the namespaces of other tenants.
.sp
Namespace metadata stores the compartment assignments for resources created by the Amazon S3 Compatibility API and the Swift API. By default, resources created by the Amazon S3 Compatibility and Swift APIs are stored in the root compartment of the tenancy.

.SS Description
.sp
Each Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenant is assigned one unique and uneditable Object Storage namespace. The namespace is a system\-generated string assigned during account creation. For some older tenancies, the namespace string may be the tenancy name in all lower\-case letters. You cannot edit a namespace.
.sp
GetNamespace returns the name of the Object Storage namespace for the user making the request. If an optional compartmentId query parameter is provided, GetNamespace returns the namespace name of the corresponding tenancy, provided the user has access to it.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
This is an optional field representing the tenancy OCID or the compartment OCID within the tenancy whose Object Storage namespace name has to be retrieved.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS get\-metadata
.SS Description
.sp
Gets the metadata for the Object Storage namespace, which contains defaultS3CompartmentId and defaultSwiftCompartmentId.
.sp
Any user with the NAMESPACE_READ permission will be able to see the current metadata. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS update\-metadata
.SS Description
.sp
By default, buckets created using the Amazon S3 Compatibility API or the Swift API are created in the root compartment of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.

All subsequent bucket creations will use the new default compartment, but no previously created buckets will be modified. A user must have NAMESPACE_UPDATE permission to make changes to the default compartments for Amazon S3 and Swift.
