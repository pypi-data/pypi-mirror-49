# LogDiv: A Python Module for Computing Diversity in Transaction Logs

LogDiv is a Python module for the computation of the diversity of items requested by users in transaction logs.

It takes two inputs:

1) A log file with transactions.
2) A file with item atributes.

Computing the diversity of items requested by users is a task of interest in many fields, such as sociology, recommender systems, e-commerce, and media studies. Check the example below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

LogDiv requires:

* Python
* Numpy - Essential
* Pandas - Essential
* Matplotlib - Essential
* tqdm - Optionnal: progression bar
* Graph-tool - Optionnal: only one function requires it


```shell
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install panda
$ pip install matplotlib 
$ pip install tqdm 
```

### Installing

To install LogDiv, you need to execute:

```shell
$ pip install logdiv
```

## Specification

### Entries format

LogDiv needs a specific format of entries to run:

- A file describing all requests under a table format, whose fields are:
* user ID
* timestamp
* requested item ID
* referrer item ID

- A file describing all pages visited under a table format, whose fields are:
* item ID
* topic 
* category

### YAML file

Codes that use LogDiv are directed by a YAML file: if you want to modify entry files, or the features you want to compute, 
you just need to modify the YAML file, not the code itself.
This file is self-explanatory.

## Examples

You dispose of two examples to familiarize yourself with LogDiv:
* Example 1 uses a short dataset to show how to use LogDiv
* Example 2 uses a dataset of more than 500 thousands of requests to show what kind of results can be obtained

These examples (dataset, script and yaml file) can be found in *datasets* directory.

### Example 1
The following example illustrates the entries format of the package.
