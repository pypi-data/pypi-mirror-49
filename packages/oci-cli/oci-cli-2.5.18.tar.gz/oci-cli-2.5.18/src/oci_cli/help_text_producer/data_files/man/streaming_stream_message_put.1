.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Emits messages to a stream. There\(aqs no limit to the number of messages in a request, but the total size of a message or request must be 1 MiB or less. The service calculates the partition ID from the message key and stores messages that share a key on the same partition. If a message does not contain a key or if the key is null, the service generates a message key for you. The partition ID cannot be passed as a parameter.
.sp
The top level \-\-endpoint parameter must be supplied for this operation.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-stream\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the stream where you want to put messages. [required]
.SS \-\-messages [complex type]
.sp
The array of messages to put into a stream.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[required]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
