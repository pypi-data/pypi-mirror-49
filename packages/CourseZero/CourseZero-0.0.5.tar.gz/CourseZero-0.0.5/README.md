These are tools developed to help me determine when my intellectual property is posted without my permission online. They are extremely rough and probably not very user friendly. That said, I am making them public in case others find them useful.  

These tools are provided in the hope that they will be useful to those seeking to protect their intellectual property, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of these tools is legal and in compliance with the Terms of Service of any subject website. 

Questions, requests, complaints, or other feedback (or pull-requests!) is welcome through this project's github page

Please understand that this is not an active project for me; I will monitor the project on github very infrequently.
