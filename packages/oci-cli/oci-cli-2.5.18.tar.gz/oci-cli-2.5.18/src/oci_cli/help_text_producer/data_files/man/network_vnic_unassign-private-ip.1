.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Unassigns a secondary private IP address from a VNIC. After the IP address is unassigned, you
can assign to another VNIC in the subnet.
.sp
This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are automatically unassigned, and then deleted when the VNIC is
terminated.
.sp
For more information about secondary private IPs, see \fI\%IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm\fP>

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-vnic\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the VNIC to unassign the private IP from. [required]
.SS \-\-ip\-address [text]
.sp
The secondary private IP to unassign from the VNIC. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
