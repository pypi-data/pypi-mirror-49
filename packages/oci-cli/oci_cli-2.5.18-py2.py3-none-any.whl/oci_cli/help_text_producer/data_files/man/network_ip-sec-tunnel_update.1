.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the specified tunnel. This operation lets you change tunnel attributes such as the routing type (BGP dynamic routing or static routing). Here are some important notes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you change the tunnel\(aqs routing type or BGP session configuration, the tunnel will go     down while it\(aqs reprovisioned.
.IP \(bu 2
If you want to switch the tunnel\(aqs \fIrouting\fP from \fISTATIC\fP to \fIBGP\fP, make sure the tunnel\(aqs     BGP session configuration attributes have been set (\fI\%bgpSessionConfig\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/BgpSessionInfo\fP>).
.IP \(bu 2
If you want to switch the tunnel\(aqs \fIrouting\fP from \fIBGP\fP to \fISTATIC\fP, make sure the     \fI\%IPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/\fP> already has at least one valid CIDR     static route.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-ipsc\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the IPSec connection. [required]
.SS \-\-tunnel\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the tunnel. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-routing [BGP|STATIC]
.sp
The type of routing to use for this tunnel (either BGP dynamic routing or static routing).
.SS \-\-bgp\-session\-config [complex type]
.sp
Information for establishing a BGP session for the IPSec tunnel.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
