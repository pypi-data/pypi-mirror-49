.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the object\(aqs OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet\(aqs pool of available addresses.
.sp
This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP If a secondary private IP is the \fI\%target of a route rule\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm#privateip\fP>, unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole and the traffic will be dropped.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-private\-ip\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the private IP. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
