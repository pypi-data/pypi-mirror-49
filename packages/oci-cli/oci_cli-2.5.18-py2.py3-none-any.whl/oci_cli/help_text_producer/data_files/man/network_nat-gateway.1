.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway, which represents a router that lets instances without public IPs contact the public internet without exposing the instance to inbound internet traffic. For more information, see \fI\%NAT Gateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/NATgateway.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
