.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a boot disk image for the specified instance or imports an exported image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.
.sp
When creating a new image, you must provide the OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image, and the OCID of the compartment containing that instance. For more information about images, see \fI\%Managing Custom Images\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an exported image from Object Storage, you specify the source information in \fI\%ImageSourceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an image based on the namespace, bucket name, and object name, use \fI\%ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an image based on the Object Storage URL, use \fI\%ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails\fP>\&. See \fI\%Object Storage URLs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#URLs\fP> and \fI\%Using Pre\-Authenticated Requests\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm\fP> for constructing URLs for image import/export.
.sp
For more information about importing exported images, see \fI\%Image Import/Export\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the image, which is simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
