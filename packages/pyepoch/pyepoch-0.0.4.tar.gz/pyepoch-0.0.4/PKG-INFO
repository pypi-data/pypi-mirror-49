Description: # pyepoch
        A simple python-based command-line utility to convert time or date stamps to epoch and back.
        
        #### Usage
        `pyepoch` is installed as a command-line utility accessible as `epoch` from the command-line.
        
        You can use it to convert time or date string formats to epoch timestamps (with milliseconds):
        
        ```
        -$ epoch '2018/1/1'
        1514764800000
        
        ```
        
        or if you specify, in seconds:
        ```text
        -$ epoch '2018/1/1' -s
        1514764800
        ```
        
        You can specify a timestamp as exact and detailed as you want it to. Additionally you can always convert back the epoch timestamp to an iso formatted date string:
        
        ```
        -$ epoch 1514764800000
        2018-01-01T00:00:00
        ```
        
        if your epoch input is in seconds you can add a `-s` flag, the tool can't determine this automatically.
        
        #### Bugs
        Feel free to report issues, this 'utility' was build out of ease as I got frustrated with manual conversion of timestamps and strings the whole time.
