        # news-fetch
        
        news-fetch was built on top of [news-please](https://pypi.org/project/news-please/) - [Felix Hamborg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixhamborg/) and [Newspaper3K](https://pypi.org/project/newspaper3k/) - [Lucas (æ¬§é˜³è±¡) Ou-Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasouyang/) 'Thank You' both you without them it will be very hard to extract online newspaper. This package consist of both features provided my Felix's work and Lucas' work
        
        news-fetch is an open source, easy-to-use news crawler that extracts structured information from almost any news website. . I built this to reduce most of NaN or '' or [] or 'None' values while scraping for some newspapers. Platform-independent and written in Python 3. This package can be very easily used by programmers and developers to provide access to the news data to their programs.
