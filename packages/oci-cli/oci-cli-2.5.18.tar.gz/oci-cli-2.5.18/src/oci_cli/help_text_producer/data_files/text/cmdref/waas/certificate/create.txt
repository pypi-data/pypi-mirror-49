Usage

   oci waas certificate create [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment in which to create the SSL certificate.
[required]


--certificate-data [text]
-------------------------

The data of the SSL certificate. [required]


--private-key-data [text]
-------------------------

The private key of the SSL certificate. [required]


--display-name [text]
---------------------

A user-friendly name for the SSL certificate. The name can be changed
and does not need to be unique.


--is-trust-verification-disabled [boolean]
------------------------------------------

Set to true if the SSL certificate is self-signed.


--freeform-tags [complex type]
------------------------------

A simple key-value pair without any defined schema. This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


--defined-tags [complex type]
-----------------------------

A key-value pair with a defined schema that restricts the values of
tags. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. This is a
complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


--wait-for-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|FAILED|UPDATING|DELETING|DELETED]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If
timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other
error, a return code of 1 is returned.


--max-wait-seconds [integer]
----------------------------

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by --wait-for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.


--wait-interval-seconds [integer]
---------------------------------

Check every --wait-interval-seconds to see whether the resource to see
if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-state.
Defaults to 30 seconds.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
