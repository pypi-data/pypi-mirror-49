.SS update
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the list of access rules in the Web Application Firewall configuration for a specified WAAS policy. Access rules allow explicit actions to be defined and executed for requests that meet various conditions. A rule action can be set to allow, detect, or block requests. The detect setting allows the request to pass through the Web Application Firewall and is tagged with a \fIDETECT\fP flag in the Web Application Firewall\(aqs log. This operation can create, delete, update, and/or reorder access rules depending on the structure of the request body. Updating an existing access rule can be accomplished by changing the properties of the access rule object with a non\-empty \fIkey\fP property in the list. Reordering of access rules can be accomplished by changing the order of the access rules in the list when updating. Creating an access rule can be accomplished by adding a new access rule object to the list without a \fIkey\fP property. A \fIkey\fP will be generated for the new access rule upon update. Deleting an access rule can be accomplished by removing the existing access rule object from the list. Any existing access rule with a \fIkey\fP that is not present in the list of access rules sent in the request will be deleted.

.SS update
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the Device Fingerprint Challenge (DFC) settings in the Web Application Firewall configuration for a policy. The DFC generates a hashed signature of both virtual and real browsers based on 50+ attributes. These proprietary signatures are then leveraged for real\-time correlation to identify and block malicious bots.
.sp
The signature is based on a library of attributes detected via JavaScript listeners; the attributes include OS, screen resolution, fonts, UserAgent, IP address, etc. We are constantly making improvements and considering new libraries to include in our DFC build. We can also exclude attributes from the signature as needed.
.sp
DFC collects attributes to generate a hashed signature about a client – if a fingerprint is not possible, then it will result in a block or alert action. Actions can be enforced across multiple devices if they share they have the same fingerprint.

.SS update
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the action for each specified protection rule. Requests can either be allowed, blocked, or trigger an alert if they meet the parameters of an applied rule. For more information on protection rules, see \fI\%WAF Protection Rules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/WAF/Tasks/wafprotectionrules.htm\fP>\&. This operation can update or disable protection rules depending on the structure of the request body. Updating an existing protection rule can be accomplished by changing the properties of the protection rule object with a non\-empty \fIkey\fP property in the list.

.SS waas\-policy
.SS Description
.sp
The details of a Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy. A policy describes how the WAAS service should operate for the configured web application.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy in the specified compartment. A WAAS policy must be established before creating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules. To use WAF rules, your web application\(aqs origin servers must defined in the \fIWaasPolicy\fP schema.
.sp
A domain name must be specified when creating a WAAS policy. The domain name should be different from the origins specified in your \fIWaasPolicy\fP\&. Once domain name is entered and stored, it is unchangeable.
.sp
Use the record data returned in the \fIcname\fP field of the \fIWaasPolicy\fP object to create a CNAME record in your DNS configuration that will direct your domain\(aqs traffic through the WAF.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the service to reside. For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a display name and domain for the WAAS policy. The display name does not have to be unique and can be changed. The domain name should be different from every origin specified in \fIWaasPolicy\fP\&.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including WAAS policies, receive a unique, Oracle\-assigned ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When a resource is created, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a list API operation for that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP After sending the POST request, the new object\(aqs state will temporarily be \fICREATING\fP\&. Ensure that the resource\(aqs state has changed to \fIACTIVE\fP before use.

.SS update
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the list of IP addresses that bypass the Web Application Firewall for a WAAS policy. Supports both single IP addresses or subnet masks (CIDR notation). This operation can create, delete, update, and/or reorder whitelists depending on the structure of the request body. Updating an existing whitelist can be accomplished by changing the properties of the whitelist object with a non\-empty \fIkey\fP property in the list. Reordering of whitelists can be accomplished by changing the order of the whitelists in the list when updating. Creating a whitelist can be accomplished by adding a new whitelist object to the list without a \fIkey\fP property. A \fIkey\fP will be generated for the new whitelist upon update. Deleting a whitelist can be accomplished by removing the existing whitelist object from the list. Any existing whitelist with a \fIkey\fP that is not present in the list of whitelists sent in the request will be deleted.

The value by which work requests are sorted in a paginated \(aqList\(aq call. If unspecified, defaults to \fItimeAccepted\fP\&.
.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
The value of the sorting direction of resources in a paginated \(aqList\(aq call. If unspecified, defaults to \fIDESC\fP\&.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
