.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the Device Fingerprint Challenge (DFC) settings in the Web Application Firewall configuration for a policy. The DFC generates a hashed signature of both virtual and real browsers based on 50+ attributes. These proprietary signatures are then leveraged for real\-time correlation to identify and block malicious bots.
.sp
The signature is based on a library of attributes detected via JavaScript listeners; the attributes include OS, screen resolution, fonts, UserAgent, IP address, etc. We are constantly making improvements and considering new libraries to include in our DFC build. We can also exclude attributes from the signature as needed.
.sp
DFC collects attributes to generate a hashed signature about a client â€“ if a fingerprint is not possible, then it will result in a block or alert action. Actions can be enforced across multiple devices if they share they have the same fingerprint.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-waas\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the WAAS policy. [required]
.SS \-\-is\-enabled [boolean]
.sp
Enables or disables the device fingerprint challenge Web Application Firewall feature. [required]
.SS \-\-action [DETECT|BLOCK]
.sp
The action to take on requests from detected bots. If unspecified, defaults to \fIDETECT\fP\&.
.SS \-\-failure\-threshold [integer]
.sp
The number of failed requests allowed before taking action. If unspecified, defaults to \fI10\fP\&.
.SS \-\-action\-expiration\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds between challenges for the same IP address. If unspecified, defaults to \fI60\fP\&.
.SS \-\-failure\-threshold\-expiration\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds before the failure threshold resets. If unspecified, defaults to \fI60\fP\&.
.SS \-\-max\-address\-count [integer]
.sp
The maximum number of IP addresses permitted with the same device fingerprint. If unspecified, defaults to \fI20\fP\&.
.SS \-\-max\-address\-count\-expiration\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds before the maximum addresses count resets. If unspecified, defaults to \fI60\fP\&.
.SS \-\-challenge\-settings [complex type]
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the \fIPUT\fP or \fIDELETE\fP call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous \fIGET\fP or \fIPOST\fP response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag provided matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
