class MatrixMutator
-------------------

.. class:: MatrixMutator

   A matrix mutator mutates alleles ``0``, ``1``, ..., ``n-1`` using a
   ``n`` by ``n`` matrix, which specifies the probability at which
   each allele mutates to another. Conceptually speaking, this mutator
   goes through all mutable allele and mutate it to another state
   according to probabilities in the corresponding row of the rate
   matrix. Only one mutation rate matrix can be specified which will
   be used for all specified loci. #


   .. method:: MatrixMutator(rate, loci=ALL_AVAIL, mapIn=[], mapOut=[], output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=["ind_id"], lineageMode=FROM_INFO)


      Create a mutator that mutates alleles ``0``, ``1``, ..., ``n-1``
      using a ``n`` by ``n`` matrix ``rate``. Item ``(i,j)`` of this
      matrix specifies the probability at which allele *i* mutates to
      allele *j*. Diagnal items ``(i, i)`` are ignored because they
      are automatically determined by other probabilities. Only one
      mutation rate matrix can be specified which will be used for all
      loci in the applied population, or loci specified by parameter
      *loci*. If alleles other than ``0``, ``1``, ..., ``n-1`` exist
      in the population, they will not be mutated although a warning
      message will be given if debugging code ``DBG_WARNING`` is
      turned on. Please refer to classes ``mutator`` and
      :class:`BaseOperator` for detailed explanation of other
      parameters.
