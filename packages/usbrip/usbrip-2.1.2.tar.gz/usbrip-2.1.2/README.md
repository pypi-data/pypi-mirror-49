Description
==========

usbrip is a small piece of software written in pure Python 3 (using some external modules though, see [Dependencies/PIP](#pip-packages)) which parses Linux log files (`/var/log/syslog*` or `/var/log/messages*` depending on the distro) for constructing USB event history tables. Such tables may contain the following columns: "Connected" (date & time), "User", "VID" (vendor ID), "PID" (product ID), "Product", "Manufacturer", "Serial Number", "Port" and "Disconnected" (date & time).

Besides, it also can:
* export gathered information as a JSON dump (and open such dumps, of course);
* generate a list of authorized (*trusted*) USB devices as a JSON (call it `auth.json`);
* search for "violation events" based on the `auth.json`: show (or generate another JSON with) USB devices that do appear in history and do NOT appear in the `auth.json`;
* *\*when installed with `-s` flag\** create crypted storages (7zip archives) to automatically backup and accumulate USB events with the help of `crontab` scheduler;
* search additional details about a specific USB device based on its VID and/or PID.

Git clone
==========

For simplicity, lets agree that all the commands where `~/usbrip$` prefix is appeared are executed in the `~/usbrip` directory which is created as a result of git clone:

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/snovvcrash/usbrip.git usbrip && cd usbrip
~/usbrip$
```

Dependencies
==========

usbrip works with **non**-modified structure of system log files only, so, unfortunately, it won't be able to parse USB history if you change the format of syslogs (with `syslog-ng` or `rsyslog`, for example). That's why the timestamps of "Connected" and "Disconnected" fields don't have the year, by the way. Keep that in mind.

## DEB Packages

* python3.6 (or newer) interpreter
* python3-venv
* p7zip-full *(used by `storages` module)*

```
~$ sudo apt install -y python3-venv p7zip-full
```

## PIP Packages

usbrip makes use of the following external modules:

* [terminaltables](https://github.com/Robpol86/terminaltables "Robpol86/terminaltables: Generate simple tables in terminals from a nested list of strings.")
* [termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor "termcolor · PyPI")

To resolve Python dependencies manually (it's not necessary actually because `pip` or `setup.py` can automate the process, see [Installation](#installation)) create a *virtual environment* (optional) and run `pip` from within:

```
~/usbrip$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
(venv) ~/usbrip$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or let the `pipenv` one-liner do all the dirty work for you:

```
~/usbrip$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
```

After that you can run usbrip portably:

```
(venv) ~/usbrip$ python -m usbrip [-h]
Or
(venv) ~/usbrip$ python __main__.py [-h]
```

Installation
==========

There are two ways to install usbrip into the system: `pip` or `setup.py`.

## `pip` or `setup.py`

First of all, usbrip is pip installable. This means that after git clonning the repo you can simply fire up the pip installation process and after that run usbrip from anywhere in your terminal like so:

```
~/usbrip$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
(venv) ~/usbrip$ pip install .

(venv) ~/usbrip$ usbrip -h
```

Or if you want to resolve Python dependencies locally (without bothering PyPI), use `setup.py`:

```
~/usbrip$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
(venv) ~/usbrip$ python setup.py install

(venv) ~/usbrip$ usbrip -h
```

:alien: **Note**: you'd likely want to run the installation process while the Python virtual environment is active (like it is shown above).

## `install.sh`

Secondly, usbrip can also be installed into the system with the `installers/install.sh` script.

When using the `installers/install.sh` some extra features become available:

* the virtual environment is created automatically;
* you can set a crontab job to backup USB events on a schedule (the example of crontab jobs can be found in `usbrip/cron/usbrip.cron`).

:warning: **Warning**: if you are using the crontab scheduling, you want to configure the cron job with `sudo crontab -e` in order to force the `storage update` submodule run as root as well as protect the passwords of the USB event storages. It's obviously **not a truly secure way** to input passwords (no secrets should be ever stored as plain text / passed as arguments on the command line due to a variety of ways of exposing such secrets, e. g. scanning `/proc` directory for new PIDs to catch short-lived processes with all the corresponding CLI args), but this is just an educational project in the end (interactive mode for secure password prompting is in the TODO list :neutral_face:).

The `installers/uninstall.sh` script removes all the installation artifacts from your system.

To install usbrip use:

```
~/usbrip$ chmod +x installers/install.sh
~/usbrip$ cd
~$ usbrip -h

# When -l switch is enabled, Python dependencies are resolved from local .tar packages instead of PyPI
# When -s switch is enabled, not only the usbrip project is installed, but also the list of trusted USB devices, history and violations storages are created
~/usbrip$ sudo -H installers/install.sh [-l/--local] [-s/--storages]
```

:alien: **Note**: when using `-s` option during installation, make sure that system logs do contain at least one *external* USB device entry. It is a necessary condition for usbrip to successfully create the list of trusted devices (and as a result, successfully create the violations storage).

After the installation completes, feel free to remove the usbrip folder.

Cron jobs can be set as follows:

```
~/usbrip$ sudo crontab -l > tmpcron && echo "" >> tmpcron
~/usbrip$ cat usbrip/cron/usbrip.cron | tee -a tmpcron
~/usbrip$ sudo crontab tmpcron
~/usbrip$ rm tmpcron
```

To uninstall usbrip use:

```
~/usbrip$ chmod +x installers/uninstall.sh

# When -a switch is enabled, not only the usbrip project directory is deleted, but also all the storages and usbrip logs are deleted too
~/usbrip$ sudo installers/uninstall.sh [-a/--all]
```

And don't forget to remove the cron job.

When installed, the usbrip uses the following paths:

* `/opt/usbrip/` — project's main directory;
* `/var/opt/usbrip/storage/` — USB event storages: `history.7z` and `violations.7z` (created during the installation process);
* `/var/opt/usbrip/log/` — usbrip logs (recommended to log usbrip activity when using crontab, see `usbrip/cron/usbrip.cron`);
* `/var/opt/usbrip/trusted/` — list of trusted USB devices (created during the installation process);
* `/usr/local/bin/usbrip` — symlink to the `/opt/usbrip/venv/bin/usbrip` script.

## Help

To get a list of module names use:

```
$ usbrip -h
```

To get a list of submodule names for a specific module use:

```
$ usbrip <module> -h
```

To get a list of all switches for a specific submodule use:

```
$ usbrip <module> <submodule> -h
```

Examples
==========

* Show the event history of all USB devices, supressing banner output, info messages and user iteraction (`-q`, `--quiet`), represented as a list (`-l`, `--list`) with latest 100 entries (`-n NUMBER`, `--number NUMBER`):

  ```
  $ usbrip events history -ql -n 100
  ```

* Show the event history of the external USB devices (`-e`, `--external`, which were *actually* disconnected) represented as a table (`-t`, `--table`) containing "Connected", "VID", "PID", "Disconnected" and "Serial Number" columns (`-c COLUMN [COLUMN]`, `--column COLUMN [COLUMN]`) filtered by date (`-d DATE [DATE ...]`, `--date DATE [DATE ...]`) with logs taken from the outer files (`-f FILE [FILE ...]`, `--file FILE [FILE ...]`):

  ```
  $ usbrip events history -et -c conn vid pid disconn serial -d "Dec  9" "Dec 10" -f /var/log/syslog.1 /var/log/syslog.2.gz
  ```

* Build the event history of all USB devices and redirect the output to a file for further analysis. When the output stream is NOT terminal stdout (`|` or `>` for example) there would be no ANSI escape characters (color) in the output so feel free to use it that way. Also notice that usbrip uses some UNICODE symbols so it would be nice to convert the resulting file to UTF-8 encoding (with `encov` for example) as well as change newline characters to Windows style for portability (with `awk` for example):

  ```
  usbrip history events -t | awk '{ sub("$", "\r"); print }' > usbrip.out && enconv -x UTF8 usbrip.out
  ```

  *Remark*: you can always get rid of the escape characters by yourself even if you have already got the output to stdout. To do that just copy the output data to `usbrip.out` and add one more `awk` instruction:

  ```
  awk '{ sub("$", "\r"); gsub("\\x1B\\[[0-?]*[ -/]*[@-~]", ""); print }' usbrip.out && enconv -x UTF8 usbrip.out
  ```

* Generate a list of trusted USB devices as a JSON-file (`trusted/auth.json`) with "VID" and "PID" attributes containing the first *three* devices connected on September 26:

  ```
  $ usbrip events gen_auth trusted/auth.json -a vid pid -n 3 -d "Sep 26"
  ```

* Search the event history of the external USB devices for violations based on the list of trusted USB devices (`trusted/auth.json`) by "PID" attribute, restrict resulting events to those which have "Bob" as a user, "EvilUSBManufacturer" as a manufacturer, "1234567890" as a serial number and represent the output as a table with "Connected", "VID" and "PID" columns:

  ```
  $ usbrip events violations trusted/auth.json -a pid -et --user Bob --manufact EvilUSBManufacturer --serial 1234567890 -c conn vid pid
  ```

* Search for details about a specific USB device by its VID (`--vid VID`) and PID (`--pid PID`):

  ```
  $ usbrip ids search --vid 0781 --pid 5580
  ```

* Download the latest version of `usb_ids/usb.ids` database (the source is [here](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids "List of USB ID's")):

  ```
  $ usbrip ids download
  ```

Yep, the banner and info messages style is inspired by the *sqlmap* project (⌒_⌒;)
