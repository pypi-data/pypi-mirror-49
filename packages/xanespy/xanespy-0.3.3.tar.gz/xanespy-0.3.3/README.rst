Xanespy is a library for analyzing X-ray absorbance spectroscopy data
for materials science, chemistry and similar fields. The major focus
is on X-ray microscopy frames collected at multiple energies and over
multiple timesteps. However, a design goal is for most (if not all) of
the calculation routines to be applicable to bulk XAS data as well.


Motivation & Features
---------------------

- Importing and analysis of transmission X-ray microscopy framesets
- Analysis of X-ray spectroscopy data (K-edge XANES and L-edge)
- Efficient analysis of large operando datasets


Installation
------------

Xanespy can be installed from the **python package index (PyPI) using pip**

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install xanespy


Usage
-----

Each beamline generally has its own importer in the
`xanespy.importers` module, which will process the data and create an
HDF5 file ready for the rest of xanespy to use

.. code:: python

    import xanespy
    
    # Example for importing from SSRL 6-2c
    xanespy.import_ssrl_frameset('<data_dir>',
                                 hdf_filename='imported_data.h5')
    
    # Load a pre-defined XAS edge or create your own subclass xanespy.Edge
    edge = xanespy.k_edges['Ni_NCA']
    # Now load the newly created HDF5 file and the X-ray absorbance edge
    fs = xanespy.XanesFrameset(filename='imported_data.h5', edge=edge)
    
    # Perform automatic frame alignment
    fs.align_frames(passes=5)
    # Fit the absorbance spectra and extract the edge position (SLOW!)
    fs.fit_spectra()
    
    # Inspect the result with the built-in Qt5 GUI
    fs.qt_viewer()


Beamlines
---------

We currently have importers for data from the following beamlines. If
you would like support a beamline that is not listed and are willing
to share some test data publicly, please `open an
issue`_.

Ptychography
------------

Xanespy has support for ptychography data from ALS beamline
5.3.2.1. Use ``xanespy.import_nanosurveyor_frameset`` to import the .cxi
files and ``xanespy.PtychoFrameset`` to load the data.
