`Gradio` is a python library that allows you to easily create input and output interfaces over trained models to make it easy for you to "play around" with your model in your browser by dragging-and-dropping in your own images (or pasting your own text, recording your own voice, etc.) and seeing what the model outputs. Gradio also creates a shareable, public link to your model so you can share the interface with others (e.g. your client, your advisor, or your dad), who can use the model without writing any code. 

Gradio is useful for:
* Creating demos for clients
* Getting feedback from collaborators
* Debugging your model during development

To get a sense of `gradio`, take a look at the  python notebooks in the `examples` folder, or read on below! And be sure to visit the gradio website: www.gradio.app.

## Installation
```
pip install gradio
```
(you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3` if you're running `python3`).

## Usage

Gradio is very easy to use with your existing code. Here is a minimum working example:


```python
import gradio
import tensorflow as tf
image_mdl = tf.keras.applications.inception_v3.InceptionV3()

io = gradio.Interface(inputs="imageupload", outputs="label", model_type="keras", model=image_mdl)
io.launch()
```

You can supply your own model instead of the pretrained model above, as well as use different kinds of models, not just keras models. Changing the `input` and `output` parameters in the `Interface` face object allow you to create different interfaces, depending on the needs of your model. Take a look at the python notebooks for more examples. The currently supported interfaces are as follows:

**Input interfaces**:
* Sketchpad
* ImageUplaod
* Webcam
* Textbox

**Output interfaces**:
* Label
* Textbox
