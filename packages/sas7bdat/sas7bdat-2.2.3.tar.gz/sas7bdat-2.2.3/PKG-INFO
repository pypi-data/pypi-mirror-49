        ===========
        
        This module will read sas7bdat files using pure Python (2.6+, 3+). No SAS software
        required! The module started out as a port of the R script of the same name
        found here: <https://github.com/BioStatMatt/sas7bdat> but has since been
        completely rewritten.
        
        Also included with this library is a simple command line script,
        `sas7bdat_to_csv`, which converts sas7bdat files to csv files. It will also
        print out header information and meta data using the `--header` option and it
        will batch convert files as well. Use the `--help` option for more information.
        
        As is, I've successfully tested the script almost three hundred sample files I
        found on the internet. For the most part, it works well. We can now read
        compressed files!
        
        I'm sure there are more issues that I haven't come across yet. Please let me
        know if you come across a data file that isn't supported and I'll see if I can
        add support for the file.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To install, run:
        
        ```
        pip install sas7bdat
        ```
        
        To create a sas7bdat object, simply pass the constructor a file path. The
        object is iterable so you can read the contents like this:
        
        ```
        #!python
        from sas7bdat import SAS7BDAT
        with SAS7BDAT('foo.sas7bdat', skip_header=True) as reader:
            for row in reader:
                print row
        ```
        
        Each row will be a list of values of type `string`, `float`, `datetime.date`,
        `datetime.datetime`, or `datetime.time`. Without `skip_header`, the first row
        returned will be the SAS variable names.
        
        If you'd like to get a pandas DataFrame, use the `to_data_frame` method:
        
        ```
        #!python
        df = reader.to_data_frame()
        ```
        
        [Variable
        attributes](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/65287/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n08fs0rt7fikeln1uh0t8v5pt25d.htm)
        are available from `reader.columns`. The order of these columns will be the same
        as the corresponding values in each `row`. Each `Column` has the following
        attributes:
        
        * `col_id` (`int`) - the column number
        * `name` (`bytes`)
        * `label` (`bytes`)
        * `format` (`str`)
        * `type` (`str`)
        * `length` (`int`)
