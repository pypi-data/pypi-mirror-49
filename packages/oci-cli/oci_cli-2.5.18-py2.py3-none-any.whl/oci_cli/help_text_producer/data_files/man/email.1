.sp
Used for optimistic concurrency control. In the update or delete call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous get, create, or update response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
For list pagination. The value of the opc\-next\-page response header from the previous "List" call. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page, or items to return in a paginated "List" call. \fI1\fP is the minimum, \fI1000\fP is the maximum. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-sort\-by [TIMECREATED|EMAILADDRESS]
.sp
The field to sort by. The \fITIMECREATED\fP value returns the list in in descending order by default. The \fIEMAILADDRESS\fP value returns the list in ascending order by default. Use the \fISortOrderQueryParam\fP to change the direction of the returned list of items.
.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
The sort order to use, either ascending or descending order.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
