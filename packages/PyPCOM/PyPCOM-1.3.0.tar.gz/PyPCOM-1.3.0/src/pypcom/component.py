class PageComponent(object):
    """The base class for all page components.

    This is the class that all page components should inherit from. Components
    are meant to represent a specific element on a page, and aren't a direct
    reference to the WebElement itself. Instead, an attempt to get the
    WebElement is only ever made if a reference is made to an attribute of the
    component that it doesn't have defined itself (see ``__getattr__`` for
    details).

    If a reference is made to an attribute of the component that the component
    doesn't have, then the component's ``_locator`` attribute is used to get
    the WebElement, and the attribute lookup is deferred to the WebElement. For
    example, if a reference is made to the ``text`` attribute of component
    ``x``, and component ``x`` doesn't have a ``text`` attribute defined for
    it, then ``x`` gets its WebElement and gets the ``text`` attribute of it.

    If the component has no ``_locator`` attribute, an exception is raised
    stating that the component cannot be referenced as an element without one.

    If the WebElement can't be found, an exception is raised stating so.

    If the WebElement is found, but it doesn't have the attribute initially
    referenced, then an exception is raised stating that the component (not the
    WebElement) doesn't have that attribute. All WebElements have a static set
    of attributes, so it's assumed that any referenced attributes that aren't
    part of that set are meant to be defined for that component, and if the
    lookup for it failed in this way, it was because it wasn't properly defined
    in the component's class.

    Components must be descriptors of their owner pages'/components' classes.
    They can be made to be subcomponents of other components to create a tree
    of ownership, accessed through dot-notation. If a component is a manager of
    another component, it can still have its own ``_locator``, which allows it
    to be treated as an element.

    For example, a 'username' component could belong to a 'login_form'
    component, and the 'login_form' component could belong to the page. In
    order to reference the 'username' component, you would say::

        page.login_form.username

    If you want to find the WebElement of the ``PageComponent`` by searching
    from its parent component's element, give the component the
    ``_find_from_parent`` attribute and set it to ``True``.

    Attributes:
        _locator (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`str`): The locator method and value to
            find the WebElement.
        driver (WebDriver): WebDriver to be used for element lookups and page
            interactions.
        _parent (PageComponent): The instance of the manager class for this
            component.
        _find_from_parent (bool): Whether or not to used the parent
            component's element as the jumping off point to find the element
            from.
