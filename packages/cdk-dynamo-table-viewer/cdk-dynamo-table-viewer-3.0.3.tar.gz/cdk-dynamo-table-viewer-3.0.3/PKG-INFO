Description: # cdk-dynamo-table-viewer
        
        An AWS CDK construct which exposes a public HTTP endpoint which displays an HTML
        page with the contents of a DynamoDB table in your stack.
        
        __SECURITY NOTE__: this construct was built for demonstration purposes and
        using it in production is probably a really bad idea. It exposes the entire
        contents of a DynamoDB table in your account to the general public.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install via npm:
        
        ```shell
        $ npm i cdk-dynamo-table-viewer
        ```
        
        Add to your CDK stack:
        
        ```ts
        import { TableViewer } from 'cdk-dynamo-table-viewer'
        
        const viewer = new TableViewer(this, 'CookiesViewer', {
          table: cookiesTable,
          title: 'Cookie Sales', // optional
          sortBy: '-sales'       // optional ("-" denotes descending order)
        });
        ```
        
        Notes:
        
        - The endpoint will be available (as an deploy-time value) under `viewer.endpoint`.
          It will also be exported as a stack output.
        - Paging is not supported. This means that only the first 1MB of items will be
          displayed (again, this is a demo...)
        - Supports CDK version 0.38.0 and above
