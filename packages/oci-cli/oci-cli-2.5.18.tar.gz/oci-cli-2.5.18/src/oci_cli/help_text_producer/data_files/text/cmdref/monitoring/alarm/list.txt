Usage
=====

   oci monitoring alarm list [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the
metric that you are searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the root
compartment. [required]


--page [text]
-------------

For list pagination. The value of the *opc-next-page* response header
from the previous "List" call. For important details about how
pagination works, see List Pagination.


--limit [integer]
-----------------

For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page, or items
to return in a paginated "List" call. 1 is the minimum, 1000 is the
maximum. For important details about how pagination works, see List
Pagination.

Default: 1000

Example: 500


--display-name [text]
---------------------

A filter to return only resources that match the given display name
exactly. Use this filter to list an alarm by name. Alternatively, when
you know the alarm OCID, use the GetAlarm operation.


--lifecycle-state [ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
-------------------------------------------

A filter to return only alarms that match the given lifecycle state
exactly. When not specified, only alarms in the ACTIVE lifecycle state
are listed.


--sort-by [displayName|severity]
--------------------------------

The field to use when sorting returned alarm definitions. Only one
sorting level is provided.

Example: *severity*


--sort-order [ASC|DESC]
-----------------------

The sort order to use when sorting returned alarm definitions.
Ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

Example: *ASC*


--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]
-------------------------------------

When true, returns resources from all compartments and
subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when
compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root
compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level
permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is
rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment
specified in compartmentId. Default is false.


--all
-----

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the --limit option.


--page-size [integer]
---------------------

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The --generate-full-command-json-input option can be used to generate
a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names
are pre-populated and match the command option names (converted to
camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id --> compartmentId), while the
values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the
sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that
accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
