        Outline
        -------
        
        This Python package handles Git integration in [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). Using GitHub credentials established as either environment variables (via the [colab-env](https://pypi.org/project/colab-env/) package) or directly by standard input, this package will clone a specified repository into your local Google Colab environment. It then allows for modification of the files inside and ulimately provides push capability back to GitHub directly from Colab.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To load GitHub functionality for pushing and pulling to private repositories using `colab-repoclone` you should include the following code at the top of your Colab notebook:
        
        ```
        !pip install colab-repoclone -qU
        import colab_repoclone
        ```
        
        Then, to create a copy of a desired repository, run the following:
        ```
        your_repo_name = colab_repoclone.clone_repository(your_repo_url)
        ```
        
        `clone_repository` also includes some optional keywords for specifying where to look for GitHub credentials and whether to pull a single branch of a repository.
        
        
        Now you can run `your_repo_name.pull()` or `your_repo_name.push()` as desired. `push` also provides optional keywords for a commit message and filepath for only pushing certain files. 
        
        
        Take it for a test-drive
        ------------------------
        
        Simply open up `colab-git/colab_repoclone_testbed.ipynb` in Google Colab and try it out!
