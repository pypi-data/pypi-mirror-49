**Opening and saving**

In contrast to better known PDF libraries, pikepdf uses a single object to
represent a PDF, whether reading, writing or merging. We have cleverly named
this :class:`pikepdf.Pdf`.

.. code-block:: python

   from pikepdf import Pdf
   new_pdf = Pdf.new()
   with Pdf.open('sample.pdf') as pdf:
       pdf.save('output.pdf')

You may of course use ``from pikepdf import Pdf as ...`` if the short class
name conflicts or ``from pikepdf import Pdf as PDF`` if you prefer uppercase.

:func:`pikepdf.open` is a shorthand for ``Pdf.open``.

The PDF class API follows the example of the widely-used
`Pillow image library <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. For clarity
there is no default constructor since the arguments used for creation and
opening are different. ``Pdf.open()`` also accepts seekable streams as input,
and ``Pdf.save()`` accepts streams as output.

**Topics**

This tutorial begins on the assumption that working with pages - splitting
and merging, saving and loading, is the most basic thing users want to do.
(The ``qpdf`` commandline tool, on which pikepdf is based, also does an
excellent job of file level PDF handling.) pikepdf makes qpdf's powerful API
more accessible.
