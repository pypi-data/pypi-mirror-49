.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the protection settings in the Web Application Firewall configuration for a WAAS policy. Protection settings allow you define what action is taken when a request is blocked by the Web Application Firewall, such as returning a response code or block page. Only the fields specified in the request body will be updated; all other fields will remain unchanged.

.SS \-\-max\-argument\-count [integer]

The maximum number of arguments allowed to be passed to your application before an action is taken. If unspecified, defaults to \fI255\fP\&.
.SS \-\-max\-name\-length\-per\-argument [integer]
.sp
The maximum length allowed for each argument name, in characters. If unspecified, defaults to \fI400\fP\&.
.SS \-\-max\-total\-name\-length\-of\-arguments [integer]

.SS \-\-recommendations\-period\-in\-days [integer]
.sp
The length of time to analyze traffic traffic, in days. After the analysis period, \fIWafRecommendations\fP will be populated. If unspecified, defaults to \fI10\fP\&.
.sp
Use \fIGET /waasPolicies/{waasPolicyId}/wafRecommendations\fP to view WAF recommendations.
.SS \-\-is\-response\-inspected [boolean]
.sp
Inspects the response body of origin responses. Can be used to detect leakage of sensitive data. If unspecified, defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP Only origin responses with a Content\-Type matching a value in \fImediaTypes\fP will be inspected.
.SS \-\-max\-response\-size\-in\-ki\-b [integer]
.sp
The maximum response size to be fully inspected, in binary kilobytes (KiB). Anything over this limit will be partially inspected. If unspecified, defaults to \fI1024\fP\&.
.SS \-\-allowed\-http\-methods [OPTIONS|GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|DELETE|TRACE|CONNECT|PATCH|PROPFIND]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-media\-types [complex type]
.sp
The list of media types to allow for inspection, if \fIisResponseInspected\fP is enabled. Only responses with MIME types in this list will be inspected. If unspecified, defaults to \fI[\(gatext/html\fP, \fItext/plain\fP, \fItext/xml\fP]\(ga.

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the \fIPUT\fP or \fIDELETE\fP call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous \fIGET\fP or \fIPOST\fP response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag provided matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
