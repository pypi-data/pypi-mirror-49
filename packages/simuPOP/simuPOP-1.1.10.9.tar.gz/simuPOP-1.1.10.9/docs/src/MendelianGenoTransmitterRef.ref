class MendelianGenoTransmitter
------------------------------

.. class:: MendelianGenoTransmitter

   This Mendelian offspring generator accepts two parents and pass
   their genotypes to an offspring following Mendel's laws. Sex
   chromosomes are handled according to the sex of the offspring,
   which is usually determined in advance by an offspring generator.
   Customized chromosomes are not handled.


   .. method:: MendelianGenoTransmitter(output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a Mendelian genotype transmitter (a during-mating
      operator) that transmits genotypes from parents to offspring
      following Mendel's laws. Autosomes and sex chromosomes are
      handled but customized chromosomes are ignored. Parameters
      *subPops* and *infoFields* are ignored. This operator also
      copies allelic lineage when it is executed in a module with
      lineage allele type.


   .. method:: MendelianGenoTransmitter.transmitGenotype(parent, offspring, ploidy)

      Transmit genotype from parent to offspring, and fill the
      *ploidy* homologous set of chromosomes. This function does not
      set genotypes of customized chromosomes and handles sex
      chromosomes properly, according to offspring sex and ``ploidy``.
