.SS Options
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the metric that you are searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the root compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.sp
When true, returns resources from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy\-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment specified in compartmentId. Default is false.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
For list pagination. The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous "List" call. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page, or items to return in a paginated "List" call. 1 is the minimum, 1000 is the maximum. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.sp
Default: 1000
.sp
Example: 500
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. Use this filter to list an alarm by name. Alternatively, when you know the alarm OCID, use the GetAlarm operation.
.SS \-\-sort\-by [displayName|severity]
.sp
The field to use when sorting returned alarm definitions. Only one sorting level is provided.
.sp
Example: \fIseverity\fP
.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
The sort order to use when sorting returned alarm definitions. Ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).
.sp
Example: \fIASC\fP
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
