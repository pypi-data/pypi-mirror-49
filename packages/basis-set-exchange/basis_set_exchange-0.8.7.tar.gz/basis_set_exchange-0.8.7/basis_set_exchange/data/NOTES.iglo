Notes about the IGLO family
===========================

These basis sets are intended for computing NMR chemical shifts.
IGLO - Individual Gauge for Localized Orbitals

The actual source of the data is unknown. Any up-to-date resources
about these basis sets is also unknown.

According to the reference, these were built upon old huzinaga basis sets
and my not be optimal for all calculations.
