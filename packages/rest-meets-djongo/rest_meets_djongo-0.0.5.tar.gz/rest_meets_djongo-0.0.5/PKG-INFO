Description: rest-meets-djongo
        ===
        A package which enables serialization of Djongo fields with 
        django-rest-framework's (DRF) serializers and viewsets
        
        ## Features
        **NOTE: This repo is currently under development, and most (if not all) 
        of its features are likely to throw errors or behave in unexpected ways; 
        use at your own risk**
        
        Similar to DRF ModelSerializers, creating serializers using 
        DjongoModelSerializer allows for the following fields to be detected and 
        automatically managed through DRF's serializer setup. These fields 
        include:
        * ObjectIDField
        * EmbeddedModelField
        * ArrayModelField (WIP)
        * ArrayReferenceField (WIP)
