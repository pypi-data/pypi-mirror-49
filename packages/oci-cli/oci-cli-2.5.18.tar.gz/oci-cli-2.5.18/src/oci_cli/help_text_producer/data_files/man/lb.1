.SS \-\-backend\-set\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the backend set to add the backend server to.
.sp
Example: \fIexample_backend_set\fP [required]
.SS \-\-weight [integer]
.sp
The load balancing policy weight assigned to the server. Backend servers with a higher weight receive a larger proportion of incoming traffic. For example, a server weighted \(aq3\(aq receives 3 times the number of new connections as a server weighted \(aq1\(aq. For more information on load balancing policies, see \fI\%How Load Balancing Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Reference/lbpolicies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI3\fP
.SS \-\-backup [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should treat this server as a backup unit. If \fItrue\fP, the load balancer forwards no ingress traffic to this backend server unless all other backend servers not marked as "backup" fail the health check policy.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-drain [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should drain this server. Servers marked "drain" receive no new incoming traffic.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-offline [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer should treat this server as offline. Offline servers receive no incoming traffic.
.sp
Example: \fIfalse\fP
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.SS Examples
.sp
When creating a load balancer, there are two main options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Providing all information when calling the \fBcreate\fP command
.IP \(bu 2
Providing minimal information to the \fBcreate\fP command then then using individual commands to "assemble" the load balancer post\-creation
.UNINDENT
.sp
Working samples for both approaches can be found \fI\%here\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/blob/master/scripts/create_load_balancer.sh\fP>\&.
.SS Providing all information at create time
.sp
Under this option, you would call the \fBcreate\fP command and specify the \fB\-\-certificates\fP, \fB\-\-backend\-sets\fP, \fB\-\-listener\fP and \fB\-\-path\-route\-sets\fP options in order to also create these items when creating the load balancer. Since those options are complex types, it is recommended that you place their input in JSON files and then specify these files as input to the command using the \fI\%file://\fP syntax. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-backend\-sets file://path/to/backend/set/file.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input certificates
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input backend\-sets
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input listeners
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input path\-route\-sets
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an alternative to providing those individal options, you can specify all the input to the command in a single file using the \fB\-\-from\-json\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-from\-json file://path/to/file/of/input.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Providing minimal information and then assembling via other commands
.sp
Under this option, you would only supply the mandatory arguments to the \fBcreate\fP command (and not any of the input marked as \fBCOMPLEX TYPE\fP) and then use other operations to add certificates, backend sets, listeners and path route sets. This approach is more applicable if you do not wish to prepare JSON input files.
.sp
The key commands you\(aqll need to be aware of are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This command
.IP \(bu 2
Create certificate
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend set
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend
.IP \(bu 2
List protocols
.IP \(bu 2
Create listener
.IP \(bu 2
Create path route set
.UNINDENT
.sp
You would tie these together in sequence by:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Create load balancer with minimal attributes
oci lb load\-balancer create

# Create a certificate bundle associated with the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
oci lb certificate create

# Create a backend set associated with the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
# You may need the details of the certificate you previously created
oci lb backend\-set create

# Add multiple backends to the backend set
oci lb backend create
oci lb backend create

# Create a path route set for a particular listener of the load balancer to route traffic to appropriate back\-end set
oci lb path\-route\-set create

# Add a listener to the load balancer (call command multiple times if needed)
# This will take a \-\-protocol option, whose valid values you can discover by oci lb protocol lists
# You may also need the details of the certificate you previously created

The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
