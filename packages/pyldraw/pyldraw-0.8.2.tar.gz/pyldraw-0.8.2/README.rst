Introduction
------------

LDraw_ is a standard format used by CAD applications that create LEGO models
and scenes. 

The `pyldraw` package provides facilities to allow users to create LDraw scene
descriptions using the Python_ programming language. Pieces are specified by
their positions, orientations and other properties in normal executable Python
scripts which are run to create model files.

The `pyldraw` package includes code to have the complete LDraw library available
to you through normal Python imports, like::

  from ldraw.library.colours import Light_Grey
  from ldraw.library.parts.minifig.accessories import Seat2X2
  from ldraw.library.parts.others import Brick1X2WithClassicSpaceLogoPattern

The actual parts library hierarchy (in which subpackage each brick is, etc...),
is still a work in progress. You can always specify parts by their LDraw code::

  rover = group()
  Piece(Light_Grey, Vector(-10, -32, -90),
            Identity(), "3957a", rover)


Compatibility
-------------

This is tested on Python 2.7, and 3.4+

Installation
------------

The simplest way is through pip::

  pip install pyldraw


Auto-generation of the ldraw.library.* package
----------------------------------------------

The ldraw.library.* package is kind of special, it is auto-generated from a LDraw parts library (complete.zip)
with the parts.lst itself auto-generated using pymklist_.
On running code that needs something in the ldraw.library, pyldraw will know (through a `sys.meta_path` hook)
and attempt to auto-generate it on-the-fly.
Considering that the toolchain complete.zip download, parts.lst generation, python code generation takes
quite some time, and we don't want to re-download anyway,
the generated library will be cached and reused on subsequent import or python scripts run.
If you setup another parts.lst or modify it, the library will be re-generated.
The cached generated library is stored in the directory where the ldraw package is, if that's user-writeable,
otherwise in an OS-dependent cache directory (somewhere in ~/.cache for example)

* Configuration

The parts.lst that is used for this generation is setup inside the configuration file (a simple YAML file)
To get some info about where the configuration file is, use `python -m ldraw.config`
You can specify where the library is generated by providing a `library` option in this configuration

Examples
--------

A number of examples are provided in the `examples` directory. When run, each
of these will write model information to the console. To create a model file
from an example, redirect its output to a file.


Part Descriptions
-----------------

Even though this package does include a list of parts derived from those supplied in
the official LDraw archive, users can download or modify this
list separately. The ldraw.library.* hierarchy will stay current with the LDraw database
setup in the configuration

Parts are available from the ldraw.library namespace as described above, but you can also use the Parts class::

  from ldraw.parts import Parts
  parts = Parts("parts.lst") # provide your custom parts.lst path

Parts can then be accessed using the relevant dictionary
attributes of the `parts` instance. For example::

  cowboy_hat = parts.minifig.hats["Hat Cowboy"]
  head = parts.minifig.heads["Head with Solid Stud"]
  brick1x1 = parts.others["Brick  1 x  1"]

Writers and Tools
-----------------

The `ldraw.writers` package aims to provide a set of classes that write out
LDraw descriptions in other file formats. Currently, it contains the `povray`
module which provides a class for writing out LDraw descriptions as POV-Ray
scenes.

The `ldr2pov` tool, uses the `povray` module to allow LDraw (`.ldr`) files
to be conveniently converted to POV-Ray (`.pov`) scene files.
Note that, since the LDraw format does not include
information about camera locations, it is necessary to pass this information
on the command line.

For example, on a GNU/Linux system, we can execute command lines like these
to take the `figures.py` example file, create an LDraw model file (`temp.ldr`),
and convert that to a POV-Ray scene file (`temp.pov`)::

  python examples/figures.py > temp.ldr
  ldr2pov /path/to/parts.lst models/figures.ldr temp.pov 160.0,80.0,-240.0
  povray +Itemp.pov +FN16 +Otemp.png +Q6

Finally, POV-Ray is used to process the scene description and create a PNG
image file (`temp.png`).

Some other tools and writers are included,

  - ldr2inv:

  Transforms a LDR file into a file containing the Bill Of Materials or Inventory of the model

  - ldr2png

  Renders the LDR file into a PNG file

  - ldr2svg

  Renders the LDR file into a vector image in SVG
