graphANNIS Python Bindings
==========================

GraphANNIS (https://github.com/korpling/graphANNIS/) is a library for corpus linguistic queries.
This are the Python bindings to its API.

While there are test cases, this project is still in a pre-release beta phase.
**Only a sub-set of the ANNIS Query Langugage (AQL) is supported yet (full support is planned)**
