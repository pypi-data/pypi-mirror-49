.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-policy [text]
.sp
The load balancer policy for the backend set. To get a list of available policies, use the \fI\%ListPolicies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/loadbalancer/20170115/LoadBalancerPolicy/ListPolicies\fP> operation.
.sp
Example: \fILEAST_CONNECTIONS\fP [required]
.SS \-\-backends [complex type]
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
[required]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the load balancer associated with the backend set. [required]
.SS \-\-backend\-set\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the backend set to update.
.sp
Example: \fIexample_backend_set\fP [required]
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-interval\-in\-ms [integer]
.sp
The interval between health checks, in milliseconds.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-port [integer]
.sp
The backend server port against which to run the health check. If the port is not specified, the load balancer uses the port information from the Backend object.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-protocol [text]
.sp
The protocol the health check must use; either HTTP or TCP. [required]
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-response\-body\-regex [text]
.sp
A regular expression for parsing the response body from the backend server.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-retries [integer]
.sp
The number of retries to attempt before a backend server is considered "unhealthy".
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-return\-code [integer]
.sp
The status code a healthy backend server should return.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-timeout\-in\-ms [integer]
.sp
The maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for a reply to a health check. A health check is successful only if a reply returns within this timeout period.
.SS \-\-health\-checker\-url\-path [text]
.sp
The path against which to run the health check.
.SS \-\-session\-persistence\-cookie\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the cookie used to detect a session initiated by the backend server. Use \(aq*\(aq to specify that any cookie set by the backend causes the session to persist.
.SS \-\-session\-persistence\-disable\-fallback [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer is prevented from directing traffic from a persistent session client to a different backend server if the original server is unavailable. Defaults to false.
.SS \-\-ssl\-certificate\-name [text]
.sp
A friendly name for the certificate bundle. It must be unique and it cannot be changed. Valid certificate bundle names include only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores. Certificate bundle names cannot contain spaces. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-ssl\-verify\-depth [integer]
.sp
The maximum depth for peer certificate chain verification.
.SS \-\-ssl\-verify\-peer\-certificate [boolean]
.sp
Whether the load balancer listener should verify peer certificates.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
