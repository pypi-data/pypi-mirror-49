.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A base object for all types of attachments between a storage volume and an instance. For specific details about iSCSI attachments, see \fI\%IScsiVolumeAttachment Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IScsiVolumeAttachment/\fP>\&.
.sp
For general information about volume attachments, see \fI\%Overview of Block Volume Storage\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Block/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-instance\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the instance. [required]
.SS \-\-type [service_determined|emulated|iscsi|paravirtualized]
.sp
The type of volume. The only supported value are "iscsi" and "paravirtualized". [required]
.SS \-\-volume\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the volume. [required]
.SS \-\-device [text]
.sp
The device name.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it cannot be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-is\-read\-only [boolean]
.sp
Whether the attachment was created in read\-only mode.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ATTACHING|ATTACHED|DETACHING|DETACHED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
