.. class:: OutOfAfricaModel

   A dempgraphic model for the CHB, CEU, and YRI populations, as defined in
   Gutenkunst 2009, Plos Genetics. The model is depicted in Figure 2, and the 
   default parameters are listed in Table 1 of this paper.

   .. method:: OutOfAfricaModel.OutOfAfricaModel(T0, N_A=7300, N_AF=12300, N_B=2100, N_EU0=1000, r_EU=0.004, N_AS0=510, r_AS=0.0055, m_AF_B=0.00025, m_AF_EU=3e-05, m_AF_AS=1.9e-05, m_EU_AS=9.6e-05, T_AF=8800, T_B=5600, T_EU_AS=848, ops=[], infoFields=[], outcome=['AF', 'EU', 'AS'], scale=1)

      Counting **backward in time**, this model evolves a population for ``T0``
      generations (required parameter). The ancient population ``A`` started at
      size ``N_A`` and expanded at ``T_AF`` generations from now, to pop ``AF``
      with size ``N_AF``. Pop ``B`` split from pop ``AF`` at ``T_B`` generations
      from now, with size ``N_B``; Pop ``AF`` remains as ``N_AF`` individuals. 
      Pop ``EU`` and  ``AS`` split from pop ``B`` at ``T_EU_AS`` generations
      from now; with size ``N_EU0`` individuals and ``N_ASO`` individuals,
      respectively. Pop ``EU`` grew exponentially with rate ``r_EU``; Pop
      ``AS`` grew exponentially with rate ``r_AS``. The ``YRI``, ``CEU`` and
      ``CHB`` samples are drawn from ``AF``, ``EU`` and ``AS`` populations
      respectively. Additional operators could be added to ``ops``. Information
      fields required by these operators should be passed to ``infoFields``. If 
      a scaling factor ``scale`` is specified, all population sizes and
      generation numbers will be divided by a factor of ``scale``. This demographic
      model by default returns all populations (``AF``, ``EU``, ``AS``) but
      you can choose to keep only selected subpopulations using parameter
      ``outcome`` (e.g. ``outcome=['EU', 'AS']``).
      
      This model merges all subpopulations if it is applied to an initial 
      population with multiple subpopulation.

   .. method:: OutOfAfricaModel.plot(filename='', title='', initSize=[])

      Evolve a haploid population using a :class:`RandomSelection` mating scheme
      using the demographic model. Print population size changes duringe evolution.
      An initial population size could be specified using parameter ``initSize``
      for a demographic model with dynamic initial population size. If a filename
      is specified and if matplotlib is available, this function draws a figure
      to depict the demographic model and save it to ``filename``. An optional
      ``title`` could be specified to the figure. Note that this function can
      not be plot demographic models that works for particular mating schemes
      (e.g. genotype dependent).
