Description: # AUG-alpha
        
        AUG is an open source augmentation library based on OpenCV. The repository contains a set of image transformations for data augmentation and artificial data synthesis.
        
        ##### Major features:
        
        * supports operations on masks and points,
        * unified interface - most magnitude coefficients are in the range [0, 1],
        * optimized operations,
        * reusable blocks of operations, e.g. transfer learning based on augmentation parameters (AutoAugment)
        * unique operations compared to imgaug/albumentations,
        * Python 3, OpenCV 4.1.
