.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new boot volume in the specified compartment from an existing boot volume or a boot volume backup. For general information about boot volumes, see \fI\%Boot Volumes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Block/Concepts/bootvolumes.htm\fP>\&. You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the volume, which is simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-backup\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
If provided, specifies the ID of the boot volume backup policy to assign to the newly created boot volume. If omitted, no policy will be assigned.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-kms\-key\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the KMS key to be used as the master encryption key for the boot volume.
.SS \-\-size\-in\-gbs [integer]
.sp
The size of the volume in GBs.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|RESTORING|AVAILABLE|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|FAULTY]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-availability\-domain [text]
.sp
The Availability Domain of the boot volume. Example: \fIUocm:PHX\-AD\-1\fP\&.
.sp
This is optional when cloning a boot volume as the newly created boot volume will be created in the same Availability Domain as its source. This is required when restoring a volume from a backup.
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment that contains the boot volume. This is optional when cloning a boot volume or restoring a boot volume from a backup. If it is not supplied then the boot volume will be created in the same compartment as the source.
.SS \-\-source\-boot\-volume\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of a boot volume in the same Availability Domain from which the data should be cloned to the newly created boot volume. You can specify either this or \-\-boot\-volume\-backup\-id but not both.
.SS \-\-boot\-volume\-backup\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the boot volume backup from which the data should be restored on the newly created boot volume. You can specify either this or \-\-source\-boot\-volume\-id but not both.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
