Description: # mobius3
        
        Continuously and asynchronously sync a local folder to an S3 bucket. This is a Python application, suitable for situations where
        
        - FUSE cannot be used, such as in AWS Fargate;
        - high performance local access is more important than synchronous saving to S3;
        - there are infrequent concurrent modifications to the same file from different clients;
        - local files can be changed by any program;
        - there are at most ~10k files to sync;
        - changes in the S3 bucket may be performed directly i.e. not using mobius3.
        
        These properties make mobius3 similar to a Dropbox or Google Drive client. Under the hood, [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) is used and so only Linux is supported.
        
        > Work in progress. This README is a rough design spec.
