These are tools developed to help me determine when my intellectual property is posted without my permission online. 
These are tools created to help me ensure that content uploaded by students to the site do not infringe my intellectual property rights.

They simply automate the process of searching the site and thus make it easier to determine which items infringe rights and which do not.

They are extremely rough and probably not very user friendly. That said, I am making them public in case others find them useful.  

These tools are provided in the hope that they will be useful to those seeking to protect their intellectual property, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The tools are provided here with no warranty or claim that their use is consistent with any law, policy, terms of use policy, or any other constraint. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THEM, YOU AGREE TO REVIEW AND COMPLY WITH ALL RELEVANT POLICIES, INCLUDING SITE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Questions, requests, complaints, or other feedback (or pull-requests!) are welcome through this project's github page

Please understand that this is not an active project for me; I will monitor the project on github very infrequently.
