        Redis task queue for Python 3 heavily inspired by Celery and RQ.
        
        Distinctive features:
        
        - At-least-once or at-most-once delivery per task
        - Periodic tasks without an additional process
        - Scheduling of tasks in batch
        - Integrations with `Flask, Django, Logging, Sentry and Datadog
          <https://spinach.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/integrations.html>`_
        - Embeddable workers for easier testing
        - Python 3, threaded, explicit... see `design choices

        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install Spinach with pip::
        
           pip install spinach
        
        Create a task and schedule a job to be executed now:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from spinach import Engine, MemoryBroker
        
            spin = Engine(MemoryBroker())
        
        
            @spin.task(name='compute')
            def compute(a, b):
                print('Computed {} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))
        
        
            # Schedule a job to be executed ASAP
            spin.schedule(compute, 5, 3)
        
            print('Starting workers, ^C to quit')
            spin.start_workers()
