.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Represents the current state of a consumer group, including partition reservations and committed offsets.
.SH AVAILABLE COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
commit
.IP \(bu 2
get
.IP \(bu 2
heartbeat
.IP \(bu 2
update
.UNINDENT
.SS commit
.SS Description
.sp
Provides a mechanism to manually commit offsets, if not using commit\-on\-get consumer semantics. This commits offsets assicated with the provided cursor, extends the timeout on each of the affected partitions, and returns an updated cursor.
.sp
The top level \-\-endpoint parameter must be supplied for this operation.
.SS Usage
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.SS \-\-stream\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the stream for which the group is committing offsets. [required]
.SS \-\-cursor [text]
.sp
The group\-cursor representing the offsets of the group. This cursor is retrieved from the CreateGroupCursor API call. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
