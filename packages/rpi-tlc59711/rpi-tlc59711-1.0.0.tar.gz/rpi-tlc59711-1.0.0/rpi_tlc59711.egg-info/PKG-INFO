Description: # tlc59711 12 channel LED PWM driver
        
        python port of the c++ version by adafruit https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TLC59711
        
        ## Chip
        
        Datasheet: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc59711.pdf
        Adafruit prototyping board: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1455
        
        One communicates with the chip via the i2c bus by toggling clk (clock) to shift the current state (low/high) of the data pin into the ICs 16bit register.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Connect the IC to your pi using any two GPIO pins
        
        | Name   | RPi Pin | RPi GPIO | TLC59711 | Adafruit TLC59711 |
        | ------ | ------: | -------- | -------- | ----------------- |
        | Data   |      18 | GPIO24   | SDTI     | DI                |
        | Clock  |      16 | GPIO23   | SCKI     | CI                |
        | 3v3    |       1 | 3v3      | 3v3      | VCC               |
        | Ground |       6 | GND      | GND      | GND               |
        
        import the library and RPi.GPIO
        
            import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
            from tlc59711 import tlc59711
        
            GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
            tlc = tlc59711(23, 24)
        
        now you can set each channel like this
        
            tlc.SetPWM(0,0xFFFF)
        
        this sets channel 0 to maximum brightness. The TLC supports 65536 brightness steps from 0 to 100%:
        
        | Value  | Brightness |
        | ------ | ---------: |
        | 0xFFFF |       100% |
        | 0x7FFF |        50% |
        | 0x3FFF |        25% |
