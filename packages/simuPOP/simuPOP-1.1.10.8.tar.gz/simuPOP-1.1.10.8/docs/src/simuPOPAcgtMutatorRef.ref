class AcgtMutator
-----------------

.. class:: AcgtMutator

   This mutation operator assumes alleles 0, 1, 2, 3 as nucleotides ``A``,
   ``C``, ``G`` and ``T`` and use a 4 by 4 mutation rate matrix to mutate them.
   Although a general model needs 12 parameters, less parameters are needed
   for specific nucleotide mutation models (parameter ``model``). The length
   and meaning of parameter ``rate`` is model dependent.

   .. method:: AcgtMutator.AcgtMutator(rate=[], model='general', loci=True, mapIn=[], mapOut=[], output='', begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=True, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=['ind_id'], lineageMode=115)

      Create a mutation model that mutates between nucleotides ``A``,
      ``C``, ``G``, and ``T`` (alleles are coded in that order as 0, 1, 2
      and 3). Currently supported models are Jukes and Cantor 1969 model
      (``JC69``), Kimura's 2-parameter model (``K80``), Felsenstein 1981
      model (``F81``), Hasgawa, Kishino and Yano 1985 model (``HKY85``),
      Tamura 1992 model (``T92``), Tamura and Nei 1993 model (``TN93``),
      Generalized time reversible model (``GTR``), and a general model
      (``general``) with 12 parameters. Please refer to the simuPOP user's
      guide for detailed information about each model.
