.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A \fInetwork security group\fP (NSG) provides virtual firewall rules for a specific set of \fI\%VNICs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/\fP> in a VCN. Compare NSGs with \fI\%SecurityLists\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/SecurityList/\fP>, which provide virtual firewall rules to all the VNICs in a \fIsubnet\fP\&.
.sp
A network security group consists of two items:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The set of \fI\%VNICs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/\fP> that all have the same security rule needs (for     example, a group of Compute instances all running the same application)   * A set of NSG \fI\%SecurityRules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/SecurityRule/\fP> that apply to the VNICs in the group
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After creating an NSG, you can add VNICs and security rules to it. For example, when you create an instance, you can specify one or more NSGs to add the instance to (see \fI\%CreateVnicDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/CreateVnicDetails/\fP>). Or you can add an existing instance to an NSG with \fI\%UpdateVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/UpdateVnic\fP>\&.
.sp
To add security rules to an NSG, see \fI\%AddNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/SecurityRule/AddNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules\fP>\&.
.sp
To list the VNICs in an NSG, see \fI\%ListNetworkSecurityGroupVnics\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/NetworkSecurityGroupVnic/ListNetworkSecurityGroupVnics\fP>\&.
.sp
To list the security rules in an NSG, see \fI\%ListNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/SecurityRule/ListNetworkSecurityGroupSecurityRules\fP>\&.
.sp
For more information about network security groups, see \fI\%Network Security Groups\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images automatically include firewall rules (for example, Linux iptables, Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an instance, make sure all of the following are set correctly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Any security rules in any NSGs the instance\(aqs VNIC belongs to   * Any \fI\%SecurityLists\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/SecurityList/\fP> associated with the instance\(aqs subnet   * The instance\(aqs OS firewall rules

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator.

.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

This option is a JSON list with items of type UpdateSecurityRuleDetails.  For documentation on UpdateSecurityRuleDetails please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/datatypes/UpdateSecurityRuleDetails\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-nsg\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the network security group. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
