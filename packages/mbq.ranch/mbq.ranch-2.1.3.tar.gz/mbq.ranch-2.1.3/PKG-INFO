Description: Ranch
        =====
        
        Standardized tooling, monitoring, and retry logic for use with Celery
        
        ## Installation
        
        Ranch is a Django application. To use Ranch with Celery, add the following to your settings file:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'mbq.ranch'
        ]
        
        RANCH = {
            'env': ENV_NAME,  # e.g. production, development
            'service': MY_SERVICE_NAME,  # e.g. os-core
        }
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Metrics
        
        Any application with Ranch installed will have Celery metrics available in [the Celery/Ranch DataDog Dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/930140/celery--ranch).
        
        ### Monitors
        
        *TODO: Include link to Invoice's monitors once they're built*
        
        You may set up monitors for your application using the metrics provided by Ranch. To get started, you might want to copy Invoicing's monitors.
        
        ### Dead Letter Queue
        
        Celery jobs that fail will be stored in the application's database for inspection and reprocessing. Ranch provides an Admin interface for this.
        
        See [OS Core's Ranch Admin](https://api.managedbyq.com/admin/ranch/loggedtask/) for an example.
        
        ### Correlation IDs
        
        Ranch can flow correlation IDs through your Celery jobs. Ranch will *not* change any of your logging configuration, so you'll still need to do that as part of your correlation ID implementation.
        
        To use the correlation ID functionality, add the following settings:
        
        ```python
        RANCH = {
            ...,
            'correlation': {
                'getter': getter_fn,  # callable with no args that returns the current correlation ID
                'setter': setter_fn,  # callable with one arg which should be set as the current correlation ID
            },
        }
        ```
        
        ### Supplemental Error Tagging
        
        Ranch provides a hook to add additional tagging information to error item metrics. This is used in OS Core to tag each error as belonging to a specific team.
        
        To use this feature, add the following settings:
        
        ```python
        RANCH = {
            ...,
            # tags_fn takes a single arg (the Ranch Task object that failed)
            # and should return a list of strings in the format "tag_name:tag_value"
            # See OS Core's usage for an example
            'extra_error_queue_tags_fn': tags_fn,
        }
        ```
