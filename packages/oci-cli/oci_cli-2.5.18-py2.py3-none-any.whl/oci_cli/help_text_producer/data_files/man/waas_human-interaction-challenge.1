.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The human interaction challenge settings. The human interaction challenge checks various event listeners in the user\(aqs browser to determine if there is a human user making a request.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-waas\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the WAAS policy. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS update
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the Human Interaction Challenge (HIC) settings in the Web Application Firewall configuration for a WAAS policy. HIC is a countermeasure that allows the proxy to check the user\(aqs browser for various behaviors that distinguish a human presence from a bot.

.SS \-\-is\-enabled [boolean]
.sp
Enables or disables the human interaction challenge Web Application Firewall feature. [required]
.SS \-\-action [DETECT|BLOCK]
.sp
The action to take against requests from detected bots. If unspecified, defaults to \fIDETECT\fP\&.
.SS \-\-failure\-threshold [integer]
.sp
The number of failed requests before taking action. If unspecified, defaults to \fI10\fP\&.
.SS \-\-action\-expiration\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds between challenges for the same IP address. If unspecified, defaults to \fI60\fP\&.
.SS \-\-failure\-threshold\-expiration\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds before the failure threshold resets. If unspecified, defaults to  \fI60\fP\&.
.SS \-\-interaction\-threshold [integer]
.sp
The number of interactions required to pass the challenge. If unspecified, defaults to \fI3\fP\&.
.SS \-\-recording\-period\-in\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The number of seconds to record the interactions from the user. If unspecified, defaults to \fI15\fP\&.
.SS \-\-set\-http\-header [complex type]
.sp
Adds an additional HTTP header to requests that fail the challenge before being passed to the origin. Only applicable when the \fIaction\fP is set to \fIDETECT\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-challenge\-settings [complex type]

.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the \fIPUT\fP or \fIDELETE\fP call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous \fIGET\fP or \fIPOST\fP response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag provided matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED|CANCELING|CANCELED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
