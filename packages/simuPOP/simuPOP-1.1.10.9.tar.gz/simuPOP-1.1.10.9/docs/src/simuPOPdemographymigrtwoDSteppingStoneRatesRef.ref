Function migrtwoDSteppingStoneRates
-----------------------------------


.. function:: migr2DSteppingStoneRates(r, m, n, diagonal=False, circular=False)

   migration rate matrix for 2D stepping stone model, with or without
   diagonal neighbors (4 or 8 neighbors for central patches). The boundaries
   are connected if circular is True. Otherwise individuals from corner and
   bounary patches will migrate to their neighbors with higher probability.
