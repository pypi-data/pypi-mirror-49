Description: # UniversalTranslator
        Final individual project for the "Tendencias en desarrollo de aplicaciones" class.
        
        ## App objective
        This CLI (Command Line App) can be used to convert from one longitude unit from the International Unit System to another one.
        
        ## App installation
        First, you need to have pip installed; it's the python package manager that you'll use to then install the application. You can get it [here](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/), however, it should be preinstalled on your system; still, I recommend upgrading to the latest version to avoid conflicts.
        
        After installing pip, you can just run this command: `pip install unitrans-evalir`
        
        When you install it with pip (beware, this will also install all of the CLI dependencies), you can then use it by running `UniversalTranslator --help`: this will display the help file with all the command options.
        
        Example:
        ```
        pip install unitrans-evalir
        UniversalTranslator --pathname input.txt --writepath output.txt
        ```
        
        This example will take the input.txt file that you have created on the folder you're in, process the contents, and write to the `output.txt` file the converted units.
        
        ### Input Format example:
        `1 m cm`: 1 meter to centimeters.
        `2 dm km`: 2 decimeters to kilometers.
