Description: # SNOW-File-Comparator
        Compares files from different branches and spits out deleted files
        
        # How to install?
        Run following command in terminal to install SNOW Comparator (snowcomp) module:
        
        <pre>pip install snowcomp</pre>
        
        # How to use?
        Create a configuration file (`config.json`) having information related branches to compare, Git repository etc.
        
        <pre>{
            "username": "[your_username]",
            "password": "[your_password]",
            "git_repo_link": "[link_of_git_repo]",
            "old_branch": "master",
            "latest_branch": "develop",
            "clone_dir": "test_clone",
            "instance_of_old_app": "[venXXXXX]",
            "ignore_deletions": ["sys_dictionary", "ua_table_licensing_config"]
        }</pre>
        
        You can add more classes in `delete_not_allowed` key. Currently only the files from above classes will be displayed if they are deleted from the new application.
        
        Now run following command in the directory where above `config.json` is saved.
        
        <pre>python -m snowcomp</pre>
        
        This will create a file named `Deleted Files.txt` having links to deleted files.
