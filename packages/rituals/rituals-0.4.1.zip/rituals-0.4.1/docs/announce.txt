Version 0.3.0 of `rituals` adds a complete set of documentation,
support for Sphinx including options to conveniently control a
'sphinx-autobuild' daemon, and a 'release.pex' task for single-
file Python application releases (optionally embedding a Python
interpreter).

There is also a mailing list now (Google groups), see "Links"
below.


ABOUT RITUALS
=============

The `rituals` package provides PyInvoke tasks that work for any
project, based on its project metadata, to automate common
developer chores like 'clean', 'build', 'dist', 'test', 'check',
and 'release-prep' (for the moment).

The guiding principle for these tasks is to strictly separate
low-level tasks for building and installing (via setup.py) from
high-level convenience tasks a developer uses (via tasks.py).
Invoke tasks can use Setuptools ones as building blocks, but
never the other way 'round – this avoids bootstrapping head-
aches during package installations using `pip`.

The easiest way to get a working project using `rituals` is
the `py-generic-project` cookiecutter template. That way you have
a working project skeleton within minutes that is fully equipped,
with all aspects of bootstrapping, building, testing, quality
checks, continuous integration, documentation, and releasing
covered.

Enjoy, Jürgen
