
*) copy c:\mingw64 to VM

*) add C:\mingw64\bin to VM PATH env. variable

*) create C:\temp

*) copy python-2.7.15.amd64.msi to c:\temp

   open cmd window "Run as administrator"
   run python-2.7.15.amd64.msi 
      CHOOSE CUSTOM INSTALLATION   <==== C:\Python35,  C:\Python36,  C:\Python37 <====
       - select Add python.ext to Path

*) pip install numpy 
   (again from cmd window "Run as administrator")
   (py37 needed unofficial binary)

*** NOTE *** the f2py executable was not created on py27.

use:  "python -m numpy.f2py " instead of  "f2py"

*) run "set_env_for_f2py.bat"

    SET GCC=C:\mingw64\bin\gcc.exe
    SET PYTHON_LIB = C:\Python27\libs

    SET LIBRARY_PATH = C:\mingw64\lib
    SET G95_LIBRARY_PATH = C:\mingw64\lib

    set C_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\mingw64\include

*) run the batch file: "run_f2py.bat"

*) for 64 bit Python27, creates py_cea.pyd
        put into subdirectory py27_64/py_cea.pyd  
        (will need to use import py27_64.py_cea as py_cea)
