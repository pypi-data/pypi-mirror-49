# Quick Start

This is intended for more advanced users with intention of quickly starting off. For more details on installation please visit the documentation at https://libneoradio2.readthedocs.io/.

```pip install neoradio2```

**Note:** Windows `pip.exe` is usually located under the Scripts directory under the Python installation directory.


# Quick Example
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import neoradio2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Open and close all the attached neoRAD-IO2 devices
    for device in neoradio2.find():
        print(device)
        handle = neoradio2.open(device)
        # Do stuff here
        neoradio2.close(handle)

```

# neoRAD-IO2 Product Line

The neoRAD-IO2 series is a family of ruggedized products that provide an isolated analog, digital or temperature interface to a PC via the PCâ€™s USB port. These tools can also be paired with Intrepid products that include a USB port such as neoVI ION, neoVI FIRE 2, RAD-Galaxy, and RAD-Gigalog. In addition, the neoRAD-IO2-CANHUB can power and convert the native UART signal to CAN or CAN FD for use in any CAN device.

The neoRAD-IO2 family communicates on an open source UART based serial communication protocol. Up to eight devices can be daisy chained. The chain length is limited by current supplied to the chain through USB. All neoRAD-IO2 devices have input to output isolation, and 2.5kV isolation between each of the eight banks. Bank to bank isolation is important because it allows the common mode voltage of each input signal to be different than the other channels in other banks. (This is a major source of measurement error and can damage to the product.) Additionally, noise on one channel will not affect other channels.

# neoRAD-IO2-BADGE Quick Start

neoRAD-IO2-BADGE is a demo board For multi-channel analog measurement tool. The device mimics the neoRAD-IO2-AIN and neoRAD-IO2-PWRRLY Products.
