        Features
        --------
        
        **GitlabIRCed** bot will let you connect your Gitlab projects with their IRC channels. There are main functions of this bot:
        
        * **Hooks**: The bot will receive web hooks sent by Gitlab on different events.
          You can configure the bot to stream these events into one or many IRC channels
          and networks.
        * **Watchers**: The bot can be configured to link an IRC channel to a project. The bot
          will watch the messages and give extra information when a MR or an Issue is mentioned.

        History
        =======
        
        0.4.1 (2019-07-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Added support for Python 3.5. Now this version
          is also tested in the CI.
        * Added support for Gitlab Personal Access Tocken in
          the 'watchers' section. Now you can watch private
          projects. Thanks Jonathan!
        * Frozen dependencies in the requirements.txt file,
          to avoid random issues like the one fixed in fb99ad91
          (yaml.load vs yaml.safe_load).
