class Board(): 
    """
    A class which represents a ludo board and runs the game of ludo.

    Notes for clarification:
    ------------------------
        - Terminology:
            - "home base": The area a player's pieces occupy at game start
            - "score base": The area a player's pieces occupy upon a score
            - "score arm": The area on the board leading directly to the score 
                base. A player's pieces cannot be hit when in this area.
            - "start position": The board space a player's piece occupies
                upon moving out of their home base.
            - "hit move": A move in which one player's piece hits another
                player's piece, moving the second player's piece back to that 
                player's home base
            - "block": a scenario in which one player has two pieces on the 
                same board position, which results in all opposing players' 
                pieces being unable to move to or past this board position.
                
        - Board Space Numbering: The start position of player0 is considered 
          space 0. 
    
    Rules:
    ------
        - If a 6 is rolled: 
            1) A player may move a piece out of their home base
            and onto the board. 
            2) The player rolls again.
        - "Hits": If a player's (e.g. player0) piece moves to the same board
        space another player's (e.g. player1) piece occupies (i.e. a player0 
        piece "hits" a player1 piece) the other player's (player1's) piece 
        moves back to their home base.
        - "Blocks": If a player's piece moves to a board space which another
        piece of the same player occupies, that space is now "blocked", and
        other players cannot move their pieces past that space.
    
    Run game:
    ---------
    Navigate to ludoSim's parent directory, launch python, and run the
    following commands:
        
    from ludoSim import *
    b = Board() # use optional input args to set the board however you'd like
    b.playGame()
    
    Attributes:
    -----------
        __numPlayers: The number of players in the game (must be an int between 
            1-4).
        __numPieces: The number of pieces each player has (must be an int >= 1).
        __players: Array of Player objects of length __numPlayers.
      	__piecePosns: Dict of piece positions ['PlayerID'+'PieceId':PiecePos] 
            of length __numPlayers * __numPieces.
        __startPosns: Numeric array with the start position for each player.
      	__scores: Numeric array of length numPlayers with the current score for 
            each player.
        __winner: A number representing the winning player (the playerID).
        __scoreArmSpaces: The number of spaces a player's piece needs to move
            once inside the score arm in order to score.
        __widthSpaces: The number of columns of length __scoreArmSpaces on each
            side of the board.
      	__boardSpaces: The total number of spaces on the board.
        __hits: Numeric array of length __numPlayers which holds the number of
          times each player hit another player's piece, where the index in the 
          array corresponds to the player ID.
        __rolls: Numeric array containing all the die rolls in the game.
        __playerTurns: Numeric array containing playerIDs, where the index in
            the array corresponds to the move number in the game.
