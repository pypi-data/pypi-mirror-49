Using EDRN Sync Services
************************

Installing the EDRN Sync Services package makes available the following
commands on your computer:

``dmccsync`` command
    The ``dmccsync`` command lets you slurp up a DMCC RDF file containing users
    that need to be entered into EDRN IC LDAP.
``dmccgroupsync`` command
    Takes a DMCC RDF users file and a sites file and imports the associated
    PI groups and collaborative groups into the EDRN IC LDAPS server.
``secureoldpasswords`` command
    Goes through all existing LDAP users and tests if they're using the old,
    insecure default password and changes those passwords to something
    randomized.
