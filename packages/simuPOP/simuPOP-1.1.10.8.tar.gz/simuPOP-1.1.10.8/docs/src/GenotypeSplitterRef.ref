.. class:: GenotypeSplitter

   This class defines a VSP splitter that defines VSPs according to
   individual genotype at specified loci.


   .. method:: GenotypeSplitter(loci, alleles, phase=False, names=[])


      Create a splitter that defines VSPs by individual genotype at
      *loci* (can be indexes or names of one or more loci). Each list
      in a list *allele* defines a VSP, which is a list of allowed
      alleles at these *loci*. If only one VSP is defined, the outer
      list of the nested list can be ignored. If phase if true, the
      order of alleles in each list is significant. If more than one
      set of alleles are given, Individuals having either of them is
      qualified.

      For example, in a haploid population, ``loci=1, alleles=[0, 1]``
      defines a VSP with individuals having allele ``0`` or ``1`` at
      locus ``1``, ``alleles=[[0, 1], [2]]`` defines two VSPs with
      indivdiuals in the second VSP having allele ``2`` at locus
      ``1``. If multiple loci are involved, alleles at each locus need
      to be defined. For example, VSP defined by ``loci=[0, 1],
      alleles=[0, 1, 1, 1]`` consists of individuals having alleles
      ``[0, 1]`` or ``[1, 1]`` at loci ``[0, 1]``.

      In a haploid population, ``loci=1, alleles=[0, 1]`` defines a
      VSP with individuals having genotype ``[0, 1]`` or ``[1, 0]`` at
      locus ``1``. ``alleles[[0, 1], [2, 2]]`` defines two VSPs with
      indivdiuals in the second VSP having genotype ``[2, 2]`` at
      locus ``1``. If *phase* is set to ``True``, the first VSP will
      only has individuals with genotype ``[0, 1]``. In the multiple
      loci case, alleles should be arranged by haplotypes, for
      example, ``loci=[0, 1], alleles=[0, 0, 1, 1], phase=True``
      defines a VSP with individuals having genotype ``-0-0-, -1-1-``
      at loci ``0`` and ``1``. If ``phase=False`` (default), genotypes
      ``-1-1-, -0-0-``, ``-0-1-`` and ``-1-0-`` are all allowed.

      A default set of names are given to each VSP unless a new set of
      names is given by parameter *names*.


   .. method:: GenotypeSplitter.name(vsp)

      Return name of VSP *vsp*, which is ``"Genotype
      loc1,loc2:genotype"`` as defined by parameters *loci* and
      *alleles*. A user provided name will be returned if specified.

   .. method:: GenotypeSplitter.numVirtualSubPop()

      number of virtual subpops of subpopulation sp
