Description: 
        polaroidme is a simple to use command-line-tool for placing an image into a
        Polaroid-like frame and optionally put a title / description on the bottom.
        The default font mimics scribbled handwriting but any (ttf-)font
        which suits your taste is supported. polaroidme offers basic features
        like auto-scaling up-/downwards and/or cropping, using any (ttf-)font,
        supports high-res output and gets the job just done well.
        It is intended & mainly used as a command-line-tool but can also be used as
        a python-module (means: it exports its core-function).
        
        polaroidme is actively maintained & developed (2019).
