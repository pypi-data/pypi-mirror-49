    """This is an improved implementation of the coloring from CASS, see doi:10.3389/fgene.2014.00237

    Every node in a graph can be assigned one or more 'd' colors which represent the local substructure
    around that node out to d edges away. The d color of a node can be expressed as a combination of the
    d-1 colors of its neighbors. Every node has a trivial d0 color that is its element type and charge.
    For example, an uncharged carbon has the d0-color C0

    If isotope resolved, the isotope symbol is added to the d0 color. e.g. 13C0 (only non-monoisotopic
    isotopes are added to the color).

    The dN color of a node is equal to its: d0 color + the dN-1 color of every neighbor + the order of the
    bond connecting that neighbor, which parantheses separating different components of the color.

    If stereo resolved, the stereo identifier of the bond is added to the bond order.

    Atoms with identical d3 colors are centered in the same substructure out to three bonds. They will
    have similar / identical J-coupling.

    This function will add a 'color' field to every atom in a mol file object and a 'color_groups' field
    to the mol file. The color_groups represent the sets of atoms with identical dN colors.

    :type molfile: :class:`~ctfile.ctfile.Molfile`
    :param int max_d: The maximum d out to which to color.
    :param isotope_resolved: If true, add non-monoisotope information to d0 colors.
    :type isotope_resolved: :py:obj:`True` or :py:obj:`False`.
    :param stereo_resolved: If true, add stereo information to bonds when constructing colors.
    :type stereo_resolved: :py:obj:`True` or :py:obj:`False`.
