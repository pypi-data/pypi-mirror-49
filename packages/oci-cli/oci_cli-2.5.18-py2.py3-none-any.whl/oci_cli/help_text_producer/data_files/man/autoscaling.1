.SS Description
.sp
An autoscaling configuration allows you to dynamically scale the resources in a Compute instance pool. For more information, see \fI\%Autoscaling\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/autoscalinginstancepools.htm\fP>\&.

.SS change\-compartment
.SS Description
.sp
Moves an autoscaling configuration into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>\&.
.sp
When you move an autoscaling configuration to a different compartment, associated resources such as instance pools are not moved.

.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the autoscaling configuration. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly.
.SS \-\-limit [integer]
.sp
For list pagination. The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-page [text]
.sp
For list pagination. The value of the \fIopc\-next\-page\fP response header from the previous "List" call. For important details about how pagination works, see \fI\%List Pagination\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm#nine\fP>\&.
.SS \-\-sort\-by [TIMECREATED|DISPLAYNAME]
.sp
The field to sort by. You can provide one sort order (\fIsortOrder\fP). Default order for TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for DISPLAYNAME is ascending. The DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
.SS \-\-sort\-order [ASC|DESC]
.sp
The sort order to use, either ascending (\fIASC\fP) or descending (\fIDESC\fP). The DISPLAYNAME sort order is case sensitive.
.SS \-\-all
.sp
Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you cannot provide the \-\-limit option.
.SS \-\-page\-size [integer]
.sp
When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only valid when used with \-\-all or \-\-limit, and ignored otherwise.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
