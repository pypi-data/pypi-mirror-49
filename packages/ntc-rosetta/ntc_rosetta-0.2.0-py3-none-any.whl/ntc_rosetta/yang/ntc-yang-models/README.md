# ntc-yang-models

This repo contains a set of yang models that are meant to be easy to consume. These are entry-level models that don't try to solve all the use cases, instead, it tries to tackle as many use cases as possible without making the data structures too complex.

You can find the documentation of the models in [read the docs](https://ntc-yang-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For more advanced use cases or needs you can check the standard models maintained by the [IETF](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/standard/ietf) or even the ones maintained by the [OpenConfig group](https://github.com/openconfig/public)
