Description: Interprocess Communication (IPC) Manager
        ========================================
        
        Interprocess Communication (IPC) Manager to help create a Command structure for sending and receiving messages between processes.
        
        
        Simple Listener/Client
        ----------------------
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # main.py
            import ipc_mngr
        
            def msg_handler(sock, cmd):
                """Handle received commands.
        
                Args:
                    sock (multiprocessing.connection.Client): Client socket that received the command.
                    cmd (object): Command object that was received.
                """
                print('Received Command:', cmd)
        
            listener = ipc_mngr.Listener(('127.0.0.1', 8111), authkey='12345')
            listener.msg_handler = msg_handler
            print("listening ...")
            listener.listen()  # Listen forever
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # send_cmd.py
            import ipc_mngr
        
            with ipc_mngr.Client(('127.0.0.1', 8111), authkey='12345') as client:
                # Send the command
                client.send("Hello World!")
