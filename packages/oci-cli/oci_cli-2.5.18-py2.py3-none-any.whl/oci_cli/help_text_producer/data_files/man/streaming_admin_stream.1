.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Starts the provisioning of a new stream. To track the progress of the provisioning, you can periodically call \fI\%GetStream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/GetStream\fP>\&. In the response, the \fIlifecycleState\fP parameter of the \fI\%Stream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/\fP> object tells you its current state.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the stream. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fITelemetryEvents\fP [required]
.SS \-\-partitions [integer]
.sp
The number of partitions in the stream. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment that contains the stream. [required]
.SS \-\-retention\-in\-hours [integer]
.sp
The retention period of the stream, in hours. Accepted values are between 24 and 168 (7 days). If not specified, the stream will have a retention period of 24 hours.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair that is applied with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross\-compatibility only. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED|FAILED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.SS delete
.SS Description
.sp
Deletes a stream and its content. Stream contents are deleted immediately. The service retains records of the stream itself for 90 days after deletion. The \fIlifecycleState\fP parameter of the \fIStream\fP object changes to \fIDELETING\fP and the stream becomes inaccessible for read or write operations. To verify that a stream has been deleted, make a \fI\%GetStream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/GetStream\fP> request. If the call returns the stream\(aqs lifecycle state as \fIDELETED\fP, then the stream has been deleted. If the call returns a "404 Not Found" error, that means all records of the stream have been deleted.
