======================
Product Category Image
======================

This module adds an *image* field on Product Categories.

Many e-commerce software have the ability to set an image on a product category, so we need to have this field in Odoo in order to sync with these e-commerce software.

Incompatible
============

This module is incompatible with *product_default_image* module.

Usage
=====

Go to the menu *Sales > Configuration > Products > Product Categories* and select a product category. You will see the image field next to the name of the category.
