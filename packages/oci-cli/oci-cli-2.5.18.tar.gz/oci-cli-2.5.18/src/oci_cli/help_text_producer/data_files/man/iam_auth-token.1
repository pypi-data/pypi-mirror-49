.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An \fIAuthToken\fP is an Oracle\-generated token string that you can use to authenticate with third\-party APIs that do not support Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\(aqs signature\-based authentication. For example, use an \fIAuthToken\fP to authenticate with a Swift client with the Object Storage Service.
.sp
The auth token is associated with the user\(aqs Console login. Auth tokens never expire. A user can have up to two auth tokens at a time.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The token is always an Oracle\-generated string; you can\(aqt change it to a string of your choice.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%Managing User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm\fP>\&.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new auth token for the specified user. For information about what auth tokens are for, see \fI\%Managing User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a \fIdescription\fP for the auth token (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateAuthToken\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/AuthToken/UpdateAuthToken\fP>\&.
.sp
Every user has permission to create an auth token for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to create an auth token for any user, including themselves.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the auth token during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. [required]
.SS \-\-user\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the user. [required]
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
