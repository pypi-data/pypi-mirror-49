        PyCssStyleguide
        ===============
        
        A Python library to build a styleguide from a CSS manifest file.
        
        It is way of building a styleguide without to write declarations inside CSS comments in your stylesheets.
        
        You build a manifest in a dedicated CSS file and it will be parsed and serialized so you can use it in your code or templates to build a styleguide.
        
        Why a dedicated CSS file for a manifest ? Because it can be automatically writed from your Sass sources. Obviously it would only work if your design is driven by variables like with *Foundation for Site* or *Bootstrap*.
        
        Manifest syntax rules are writed so the CSS file is still a valid CSS, mostly using CSS3 variables.
        
        This library provides:
        
        * An API to load a CSS manifest and return it has structured datas;
        * A Sass source with some mixin helpers to help you to write CSS manifest from your Sass sources;
        
        This library doesn't provide template or application to build the styleguide page, it's up to you to integrate it in your project.
