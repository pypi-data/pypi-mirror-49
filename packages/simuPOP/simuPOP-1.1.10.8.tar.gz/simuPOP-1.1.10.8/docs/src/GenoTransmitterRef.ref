class GenoTransmitter
---------------------

.. class:: GenoTransmitter

   This during mating operator is the base class of all genotype
   transmitters. It is made available to users because it provides a
   few member functions that can be used by derived transmitters, and
   by customized Python during mating operators.


   .. method:: GenoTransmitter(output="", begin=0, end=-1, step=1, at=[], reps=ALL_AVAIL, subPops=ALL_AVAIL, infoFields=[])


      Create a base genotype transmitter.


   .. method:: GenoTransmitter.clearChromosome(ind, ploidy, chrom)

      Clear (set alleles to zero) chromosome *chrom* on the *ploidy-
      th* homologous set of chromosomes of individual *ind*. It is
      equivalent to ``ind.setGenotype([0], ploidy, chrom)``, except
      that it also clears allele lineage if it is executed in a module
      with lineage allele type.

   .. method:: GenoTransmitter.copyChromosome(parent, parPloidy, offspring, ploidy, chrom)

      Transmit chromosome *chrom* on the *parPloidy* set of homologous
      chromosomes from *parent* to the *ploidy* set of homologous
      chromosomes of *offspring*. It is equivalent to
      ``offspring.setGenotype(parent.genotype(parPloidy, chrom),
      polidy, chrom)``, except that it also copies allelic lineage
      when it is executed in a module with lineage allele type.

   .. method:: GenoTransmitter.copyChromosomes(parent, parPloidy, offspring, ploidy)

      Transmit the *parPloidy* set of homologous chromosomes from
      *parent* to the *ploidy* set of homologous chromosomes of
      *offspring*. Customized chromosomes are not copied. It is
      equivalent to
      ``offspring.setGenotype(parent.genotype(parPloidy), ploidy)``,
      except that it also copies allelic lineage when it is executed
      in a module with lineage allele type.
