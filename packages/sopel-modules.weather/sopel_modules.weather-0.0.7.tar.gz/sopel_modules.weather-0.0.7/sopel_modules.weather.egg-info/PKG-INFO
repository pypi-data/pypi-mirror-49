        # sopel-weather
        sopel-weather is an weather lookup module for Sopel.
        
        Since Yahoo deprecated their weather API on January 3, 2019, a reimplementation of the weather module was necessary 
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        # Allows the user to set their current location
        .setlocation london # Sets location by city name
        .setlocation w2643743 # Sets location by WOEID (We are prepending w in front of WOEIDs because they collide with zips)
        .setlocation 98101 # Sets location by zip code
        
        # Gets a 24h forecast
        .forecast # Only works if setlocation has been previously run
        .forecast seattle, us
        .forecast london
        
        # Gets the current weather
        .weather # Only works if setlocation has been previously run
        .weather seattle, us
        .weather london
        ```
