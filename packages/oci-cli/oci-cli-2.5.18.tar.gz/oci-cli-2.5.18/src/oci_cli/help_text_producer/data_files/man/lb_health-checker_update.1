.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-protocol [text]
.sp
The protocol the health check must use; either HTTP or TCP.
.sp
Example: \fIHTTP\fP [required]
.SS \-\-port [integer]
.sp
The backend server port against which to run the health check.
.sp
Example: \fI8080\fP [required]
.SS \-\-return\-code [integer]
.sp
The status code a healthy backend server should return.
.sp
Example: \fI200\fP [required]
.SS \-\-retries [integer]
.sp
The number of retries to attempt before a backend server is considered "unhealthy".
.sp
Example: \fI3\fP [required]
.SS \-\-timeout\-in\-millis [integer]
.sp
The maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for a reply to a health check. A health check is successful only if a reply returns within this timeout period.
.sp
Example: \fI3000\fP [required]
.SS \-\-interval\-in\-millis [integer]
.sp
The interval between health checks, in milliseconds.
.sp
Example: \fI10000\fP [required]
.SS \-\-response\-body\-regex [text]
.sp
A regular expression for parsing the response body from the backend server.
.sp
Example: \fI^((?!false).|s)*$\fP [required]
.SS \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the load balancer associated with the health check policy to be updated. [required]
.SS \-\-backend\-set\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the backend set associated with the health check policy to be retrieved.
.sp
Example: \fIexample_backend_set\fP [required]
.SS \-\-url\-path [text]
.sp
The path against which to run the health check.
.sp
Example: \fI/healthcheck\fP
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACCEPTED|IN_PROGRESS|FAILED|SUCCEEDED]
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
