Reaction Network Viewer (ReNView)
=================================

The **Re**action **N**etwork **View**er (ReNView) generates a graphic representation of the reaction fluxes within the system essential for identifying dominant reaction pathways and mechanism reduction.

Documentation
-------------

See our [documentation page](https://github.com/VlachosGroup/ReNView/wiki/Manual) for examples, and equations used.

Developer
---------
Udit Gupta (ugupta@udel.edu)

Dependencies
------------

- Python3
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) : Used for vector and matrix operations
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used to import data from input files and process headers
- [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/): Used to generate visualizations from text files

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install using pip::

>  pip install --user renview
  
Files for using the Visualization tool
--------------------------------------
1) species_comp.out - A species composition file specifying species name, phase, and the elemental composition of the molecule. In case of heterogeneous systems, surface coverages can also be provided for node coloring.

2) reaction_rates.out - A reactions file specifying the forward, reverse, net rate, partial equilibrium index, and reaction string. The reaction string should contain species names as mentioned in the species_comp.out file.

Features in the visualization tool:
-----------------------------------
- Network Visualization
- Species Visualization
- Legend generation
