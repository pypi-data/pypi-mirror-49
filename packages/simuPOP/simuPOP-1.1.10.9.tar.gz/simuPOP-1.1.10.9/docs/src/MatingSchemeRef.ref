class MatingScheme
------------------

.. class:: MatingScheme

   This mating scheme is the base class of all mating schemes. It
   evolves a population generation by generation but does not actually
   transmit genotype.


   .. method:: MatingScheme(subPopSize=[])


      Create a base mating scheme that evolves a population without
      transmitting genotypes. At each generation, this mating scheme
      creates an offspring generation according to parameter
      *subPopSize*, which can be a list of subpopulation sizes (or a
      number if there is only one subpopulation) or a Python function
      which will be called at each generation, just before mating, to
      determine the subpopulation sizes of the offspring generation.
      The function should be defined with one or both parameters of
      ``gen`` and ``pop`` where ``gen`` is the current generation
      number and ``pop`` is the parental population just before
      mating. The return value of this function should be a list of
      subpopulation sizes for the offspring generation. A single
      number can be returned if there is only one subpopulation. The
      passed parental population is usually used to determine
      offspring population size from parental population size but you
      can also modify this population to prepare for mating. A common
      practice is to split and merge parental populations in this
      function so that you demographic related information and actions
      could be implemented in the same function.
