        **GAlibrate** is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for model calibration/parameter estimation using an implementation of continuous genetic algorithm-based optimization. Its functionality and API were designed to be familiar to users of the [PyDREAM](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyDREAM), [simplePSO](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/ParticleSwarmOptimization), and [Gleipnir](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir) packages.
        
        Although **GAlibrate** provides a general framework for running continuous
        genetic algorithm-based optimizations, it was created with systems biology models in mind. It therefore supplies additional tools for working with biological models in the [PySB](http://pysb.org/) format.
        
        ------
        
        # Install
        
        | **! Warning** |
        | :--- |
        |  GAlibrate is still under heavy development and may rapidly change. |
        
        **GAlibrate** installs as the `galibrate` package. It is compatible (i.e., tested) with Python 3.6 and 3.7.
        
        Note that `galibrate` has the following core dependencies:
           * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
           * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
        
        #### pip install
        You can install the latest release of the `galibrate` package using `pip` sourced from the GitHub repo:
        ```
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate@v0.4.0#egg=galibrate
        ```
        However, this will not automatically install the core dependencies. You will have to do that separately:
        ```
        pip install numpy scipy
        ```
        #### conda install
        You can install the `galibrate` package from the `blakeaw` channel:
        ```
        conda install -c blakeaw galibrate
        ```
        NumPy and SciPy dependencies will be automatically installed with this version.
        
        ### Recommended additional software
        
        The following software is not required for the basic operation of **GAlibrate**, but provides extra capabilities and features when installed.
        
        #### Cython
        **GAlibrate** includes an implementation of the core genetic algorithm that is written in   [Cython](https://cython.org/), which takes advantage of Cython-based optimizations and compilation to accelerate the algorithm. This version of genetic algorithm is used if Cython is installed.
        
        #### Numba
        **GAlibrate** also includes an implementation of the core genetic algorithm that takes advantage of [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)-based JIT compilation and optimization to accelerate the algorithm. This version of genetic algorithm is used if Numba is installed.
        
        #### PySB
        [PySB](http://pysb.org/) is needed to run PySB models, and it is therfore needed if you want to use tools from the galibrate.pysb_utils package.

        # Documentation and Usage
        
        ### Quick Overview
        Principally, **GAlibrate** defines the **GAO** (continuous **G**enetic **A**lgorithm-based **O**ptimizer ) class,
        ```python
        from galibrate import GAO
        ```
        which defines an object that can be used setup and run a continuous genetic algorithm-based optimization (i.e., a maximization) of a user-defined fitness function over the search space of a given set of (model) parameters.
        
        Additionally, **GAlibrate** has a `pysb_utils` sub-package that provides the
        `galibrate_it` module, which defines the GaoIt and GAlibrateIt classes (importable from the pysb_utils package level),
        ```python
        from galibrate.pysb_utils import GaoIt, GAlibrateIt
        ```  
        which create objects that abstract away some of the effort to setup and generate GAO instances for PySB models; [examples/pysb_dimerization_model](./examples/pysb_dimerization_model) provides some
        examples for using GaoIt and GAlibrateIt objects. The `galibrate_it` module can also be called from the command line to generate a template run script for a PySB model,
        ```python
        python -m galibrate.pysb_utils.galibrate_it pysb_model.py output_path
        ```
        which users can then modify to fit their needs.
        
        ### Examples
        Additional example scripts that show how to setup and launch Genetic Algorithm runs using **GAlibrate** can be found under [examples](./examples).
