        ## Server setting
        
        Please config [jupyter server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html) like the following:
        ```
        c.NotebookApp.token = 'ABCD'   #it is good to use token mode for web api call to pass through
        c.NotebookApp.allow_remote_access = True  #if you like to set to access from other computer
        ```
        ## Example
        The following screenshot shows the sample notebook file with a function sum. You can download TestingJupyter.ipynb or create your own.  The following is an instance I hosted in google cloud platform, you can open and add a function of yours.
        '''
        http://34.73.64.35:8888/Excel/TestingJupyter.ipynb?token=ABCD&functionname=sum&1=11&2=8&3=6
